A proposal to conclude a contract made through one or more electronic communications which is not addressed to one or more specific parties, but is generally accessible to parties making use of information systems, including a proposal that makes use of interactive applications for the placement of orders through such information systems, is to be considered as an invitation to make offers, unless it clearly indicates the intention of the party making the proposal to be bound in case of acceptance.

Where a natural person makes an input error in an electronic communication exchanged with the electronic agent of another party and the electronic agent does not provide the person with an opportunity to correct the error, that natural person, or the party on whose behalf that person was acting, has the right to withdraw the portion of the electronic communication in which the input error was made if:

# 15. Acknowledgement of Receipt of Electronic communications

a. Where, on or before sending an electronic communication, the originator has requested or has agreed with the addressee that receipt of the electronic communication be acknowledged:

1. If the originator has not agreed with the addressee that the acknowledgement of the receipt of the electronic communication be given in a particular form or by a particular method, an acknowledgement may, provided that it is sufficient to indicate to the originator that the electronic communication has been received, be given by any conduct of the addressee or any communication by the addressee, automated or otherwise.  
2. If the originator has stated that the electronic communication is conditional on receipt of an acknowledgement, the electronic communication is treated as though it has never been sent until the acknowledgement is received; or  
3. If the originator has requested an acknowledgement of receipt but has not stated that the validity of the electronic communication is conditional on receipt of an acknowledgement, within a time specified or agreed or, if no time has been specified or agreed, within a reasonable time, the originator may give notice to the addressee stating that no acknowledgement has been received and specifying a reasonable time by which the acknowledgement must be received; and if the acknowledgement is not received within the time specified the originator may, upon notice to the addressee, treat the electronic communication as though it had never been sent, or exercise any other rights the originator may have under the law.

b. Where the originator receives the addressee's acknowledgement of receipt, it is presumed, until proven otherwise, that the related electronic communication was received by the

addressee. That presumption does not imply that the content of the electronic communication sent corresponds to the record received.

c. Where the acknowledgement received by the originator states that the related electronic communication met technical requirements, either agreed upon or set forth in the criteria in force, it is presumed that those requirements have been met until proven otherwise.

d. The provisions of this section applies only to the sending or receipt of the electronic communication, and is not intended to address the legal consequences that may flow from that electronic communication and the acknowledgement of its receipt.

1. Unless agreed otherwise between the originator and addressee, the time of dispatch of an electronic communication is the time when it leaves an information system under the control of the originator or of the party who sent it on behalf of the originator; or, where the electronic communication has not left an information system under the control of the originator or of the party who sent it on behalf of the originator, the time when the electronic communication is received.  
2. Unless agreed otherwise between the originator and addressee, the time of receipt of an electronic communication is the time when it becomes capable of being retrieved by the addressee at an electronic address designated by the addressee; and the time of receipt of an electronic communication at another electronic address of the addressee is the time when it becomes capable of being retrieved by the addressee at that address and the addressee becomes aware that the electronic communication has been sent to that address. For the purposes of this subsection, an electronic communication is presumed unless proven otherwise to be capable of being retrieved by the addressee when it reaches the addressee's electronic address.  
3. Unless agreed otherwise between the originator and addressee, an electronic communication is deemed to be dispatched at the place where the originator has its place of business, and is deemed to be received at the place where the addressee has its place of business.  
4. Subsection (b) shall apply notwithstanding that the place where the information system supporting an electronic address is located may be different from the place where the electronic communication is deemed to be received under subsection (c).

# 17. Location of the Parties

1. A party's place of business in any transaction is the location indicated by that party, unless another party demonstrates that the party making the indication does not have a place of business at that location.  
2. If a party has not indicated a place of business and has more than one place of business, then the place of business for the purposes of this law is that which has the closest relationship to the relevant transaction, having regard to the circumstances known to or contemplated by the parties at any time before or at the conclusion of the transaction; or where there is no underlying transaction in relation to the electronic communication the place of business is the principal place of business.

3. If a person does not have a place of business, reference is to be made to the person's habitual residence.  
4. A location is not a place of business merely because that is where equipment and technology supporting an information system used by a party to the transaction is located; or where the information system may be accessed by third parties.  
5. The sole fact that a party makes use of an electronic address or a domain name that is connected to a specific country does not create a presumption that its place of business is located in that country.

# 18. Notarization Using Electronic Means

1. Documents may be notarized and authenticated using electronic means. The competent Minister for justice affairs shall, after coordinating with the concerned bodies, issue a regulation specifying conditions and information technology standards that to be used for the purpose of ascertaining the identity of those requiring notarization, and for the creation, dispatch, retention and security of the electronic records related to the electronic notarization, type of electronic signature required for notarization, form for affixing the electronic signature on the document and specifying the documents that may be notarized or authenticated using electronic means.
