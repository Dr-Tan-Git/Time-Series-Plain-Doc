1. Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with this Law. Those measures shall be reviewed and updated where necessary.  
2. Where proportionate in relation to processing activities, the measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall include the implementation of appropriate data protection policies by the controller.

# Article 24 Data protection by design and by default

1. Taking into account the state of technology, the cost of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for rights and freedoms of natural persons posed by the processing, the controller shall, both at the time of the determination of the means for processing and at the time of processing itself, implement appropriate technical and organisational measures, such as pseudonymization, which are designed to implement data-protection principles, such as data minimisation, in an effective manner and to integrate the necessary safeguards into the processing in order to meet the requirements of this Law and protect the rights of data subjects.  
2. The controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures for

ensuring that, by default, only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are processed. That obligation applies to the amount of personal data collected, the extent of their processing, the period of their storage and their accessibility. In particular, such measures shall ensure that by default personal data are not made accessible without the individual's intervention to an indefinite number of natural persons.

3. An approved certification mechanism as referred to in Article 43 of this Law may be used as an element to demonstrate compliance with the requirements stipulated in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article.

# Article 25 Joint controllers

1. If two (2) or more controllers jointly determine the purposes and means of processing, they shall be joint controllers. They shall in a transparent manner determine their respective responsibilities for compliance with the obligations under the law, in particular as regards the exercising of the rights of the data subject and their respective duties to provide the information referred to in Articles 12 and 13 of this Law, by means of an arrangement between them. The arrangement may designate a contact point for data subjects.

1. If processing is to be carried out on behalf of a controller, the controller shall use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that processing will meet the requirements of this Law and ensure the protection of the rights of the data subject.  
2. The processor shall not engage another processor without prior specific or general written authorisation of the controller. In the case of general written authorisation, the processor shall inform the controller of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of other processors, thereby giving the controller the opportunity to object to such changes.  
3. Processing by a processor shall be governed by a contract that is binding on the processor with regard to the controller and that sets out the subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the controller. This contract shall stipulate, in particular, that the processor:

3.1. processes personal data only according to documented instructions from the controller, including with regard to transfers of personal data to a foreign country or an international organisation, unless required to do so by a special law to which the processor is subject; in such a case, the processor shall inform the controller of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest. The processor shall immediately inform the controller if, according to his opinion, a certain rule is in contradiction with this law;  
3.2. ensures that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality;  
3.3. takes all measures required pursuant to Article 31 of this Law;

4. If a processor engages another processor for carrying out specific processing activities on behalf of the controller, the same data protection obligations as set out in the contract or other legal act between the controller and the processor as referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article

shall be imposed on that other processor by way of a contract or other legal act under applicable legislation, in particular providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that the processing will meet the requirements of this law. If that other processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations, the initial processor shall remain fully liable to the controller for the performance of that other processor's obligations.

5. Without prejudice to an individual contract between the controller and the processor, the contract or the other legal act referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article may be based, in whole or in part, on standard contractual clauses referred to in paragraphs 6 and 7 of this Article, including when they are part of a certification granted to the controller or processor pursuant to Article 43.  
6. Respect of the approved code of conduct by the processor as referred to in Article 41 of this Law or of the approved mechanism of certification as referred to in Article 43 of this Law, may be used as an element by which sufficient guarantees shall be documented, as referred to in paragraphs 1 and 4 of this Article.  
7. The Agency may lay down standard contractual clauses for the matters referred to in paragraph 3 and 4 of this Article.  
8. The contract or the other legal act referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article shall be in writing, including in electronic form.

3. Adherence to an approved code of conduct as referred to in Article 41 of this Law or an approved certification as referred to in Article 43 of this Law may be used as an element by

which to demonstrate compliance with the requirements set out in paragraph 1 of this Article.

4. The controller and processor shall take steps to ensure that any natural person acting under the authority of the controller or the processor who has access to personal data does not process them except on instructions from the controller, unless he or she is required to do so by any specific law.

# Article 32 Intracted processing

1. Personal data processor may be entrusted to a data processor under a written contract, to conduct such operations pursuant to procedures and security measures.  
2. Data processor may act only within the constraints of the authorizations given by data controller and is not entitled to process personal data for other purposes. Mutual rights and obligations should be specified by a written contract, which should also contain a detailed description of procedures and measures in accordance with Article 32 of this Law.  
3. Data controllers should oversee implementation of procedures and measures in accordance with Article 32 of this Law. They should also conduct periodical visits to the premises where personal data are processed.  
4. In case of a dispute between the data controller and processor, the latter should immediately, upon controller's request, return all the data in possession. The data processor is not allowed to keep copies of and further process them.  
5. In case of discontinuation of data processor's activity, personal data shall immediately be returned to the data controller.

# Article 33 Notification of a personal data breach to the Agency

1. In the case of a personal data breach, the controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than seventy-two (72) hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the Agency, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Where the notification to the Agency is not made within seventy-two (72) hours, it shall be accompanied by reasons for the delay.

The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall describe in clear and plain language the nature of the personal data breach and contain at least the information and measures referred to in paragraph 3, sub paragraphs 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 of Article 33 of this Law.  
3. The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall not be required if any of the following conditions are met:

3.1. the controller has implemented appropriate technical and organisational protection measures, and those measures were applied to the personal data affected by the personal data breach, in particular those that render the personal data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it, such as encryption;  
3.2. the controller has taken subsequent measures which ensure that the high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article is no longer likely to materialise;  
3.3. it would involve disproportionate effort. In such a case, there shall instead be a public communication or similar measure whereby the data subjects are informed in an equally effective manner.

4. If the controller has not already communicated the personal data breach to the data subject, the Agency, having considered the likelihood of the personal data breach resulting in a high risk, may require it to do so or may decide that any of the conditions referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article are met.

# CHAPTER IX DATA PROTECTION IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND PRIOR CONSULTATION

# Article 35 Data protection impact assessment

1. Where a type of processing in particular using new technologies, and taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall, prior to the processing, carry out an assessment of the impact of the envisaged processing operations on the protection of personal data. A single assessment may address a set of similar processing operations that present similar high risk.  
2. The controller shall seek the advice of the data protection officer, where designated, when carrying out a data protection impact assessment.

3. A data protection impact assessment referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall in particular be required in the case of:

3.1. a systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural persons which is based on automated processing, including profiling, and on which decisions are based that produce legal effects concerning the natural person or similarly significantly affect the natural person;
