CHAPTER 748

An act to amend Section 1798.140 of the Civil Code, relating to consumer privacy.

[ Approved by Governor  October 11, 2019. Filed with Secretary of State  October 11, 2019. ]

LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST

AB 874, Irwin. California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018.
Existing law, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, beginning on January 1, 2020, grants consumers various rights with regard to their personal information held by businesses, including the right to request a business to disclose specific pieces of personal information it has collected and the right to request a business to delete any personal information collected by the business. The act generally provides for its enforcement by the Attorney General, but also provides for a private right of action in certain circumstances.
The act defines “personal information” to mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. The act excludes “publicly available information” from the definition of “personal information,” and defines the term “publicly available” to mean information that is lawfully made available from federal, state, or local government records, if any conditions associated with that information. Existing law further specifies that information is not “publicly available” if that data is used for a purpose that is not compatible with the purpose for which the data is maintained and made available in the government records or for which it is publicly maintained and specifies that “publicly available” does not include consumer information that is deidentified or aggregate consumer information.
This bill would redefine “personal information” to mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. The bill would also define “publicly available” to mean information that is lawfully made available from federal, state, or local records. The bill would delete the above language specifying the conditions in which that information is not “publicly available.” The bill would, instead, provide that “personal information” does not include deidentified or aggregate consumer information. The bill would make related changes.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 1798.140 of the Civil Code proposed by AB 1355 to be operative only if this bill and AB 1355 are enacted and this bill is enacted last.

(D) The business transfers to a third party the personal information of a consumer as an asset that is part of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or other transaction in which the third party assumes control of all or part of the business, provided that information is used or shared consistently with Sections 1798.110 and 1798.115. If a third party materially alters how it uses or shares the personal information of a consumer in a manner that is materially inconsistent with the promises made at the time of collection, it shall provide prior notice of the new or changed practice to the consumer. The notice shall be sufficiently prominent and robust to ensure that existing consumers can easily exercise their choices consistently with Section 1798.120. This subparagraph does not authorize a business to make material, retroactive privacy policy changes or make other changes in their privacy policy in a manner that would violate the Unfair and Deceptive Practices Act (Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 17200) of Part 2 of Division 7 of the Business and Professions Code).

A business is not obligated to provide information to the consumer pursuant to Sections 1798.100, 1798.105, 1798.110, and 1798.115 if the business cannot verify, pursuant to this subdivision and regulations adopted by the Attorney General pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (a) of Section 1798.185, that the consumer making the request is the consumer about whom the business has collected information or is a person authorized by the consumer to act on such consumer’s behalf.
