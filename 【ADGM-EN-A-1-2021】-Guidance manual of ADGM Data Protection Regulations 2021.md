# Introduction

The Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), an international financial free zone in Abu Dhabi, enacted the new ADGM Data Protection Regulations 2021 on the  $11^{\text{th}}$  of February 2021. The new Regulations repeal the existing Data Protection Regulations 2015 and mandate additional obligations and responsibilities for entities that process personal data.

# What do the updated Regulations entail?

The updated Regulations are a new chapter in the ADGM's long-standing commitment to globally recognized standards of data protection.

The goal is to establish enhanced governance and transparency requirements that will facilitate the ADGM's alignment with international laws and Regulations.

# When do the Regulations come into effect?

For new entities incorporated on or after the 14th February 2021, the new Regulations come into effect on the 14th August 2021. For existing entities, the Regulations will come into effect on the 14th February 2022.

# Who is affected by the new Regulations?

The new Regulations apply to all entities established in the ADGM. If your entity is processing personal data, or processing in the context of the activities of an establishment in the ADGM, the new Regulations apply. Personal data is defined broadly in the new Regulations and covers any information that can identify a living person (i.e. a Data Subject).

# Data Protection by Design and Default

Data Protection by Design and Default is ultimately an approach that ensures you consider privacy and data protection issues at the design phase of any system, service, product, or process and then throughout its implementation and operation, including any updates or expansion, and at its ultimate termination, closure, or migration.

Data Protection by Design and Default must be considered throughout the lifecycle of a processing activity or processing system: at development, design, and at the point of processing.

# Ways in which Data Protection by Design and Default might be implemented include:

Putting in place appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to implement the data protection principles.

Building safeguards into your processing activities so that you meet the requirements of the DPR 2021 and protect individual rights.

Personal Data should not be transferred outside of ADGM without appropriate safeguards. There are three mechanisms of transfers:

1. Adequacy: The recipient is located in a jurisdiction that provides an adequate level of protection. The list of adequate jurisdictions is on the ADGM ODP website  
2. Appropriate Safeguards: The exporter can rely upon suitable safeguards to transfer personal data. In particular, ADGM-approved Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs).  
3. Derogation: The exporter could transfer personal data if certain conditions exist. The conditions are as follows:

# 66

Transfer provisions exist in the Regulations to allow the free flow of personal data outside of ADGM. The purpose of these conditions is to ensure data is given an appropriate level of protection irrespective of the destination.

$\checkmark$  Consent of the individual is provided for the transfer  
âœ“ Necessary for the performance of a contract between an individual and the Controller  
$\checkmark$  Necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract  
$\checkmark$  Necessary for important reasons of public interest in ADGM  
Required by law enforcement agencies of the UAE  
$\checkmark$  Necessary to protect a person's life  
$\checkmark$  For the exercise or defense of legal claims  
$\checkmark$  Necessary to comply with certain specific regulatory requirements
