LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST

AB 656, Schiavo. Account cancellation.
Existing law generally regulates social media platforms, including by requiring a social media company to post terms of service for each social media platform owned or operated by the company in a manner reasonably designed to inform all users of the social media platform of the existence and contents of the terms of service, as prescribed.
Existing law, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), grants a consumer various rights with respect to personal information that is collected or sold by a business, including the right to request that a business delete personal information about the consumer that the business has collected from the consumer, as specified. Existing law, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, an initiative measure approved by the voters as Proposition 24 at the November 3, 2020, statewide general election, amended, added to, and reenacted the CCPA.
This bill would require a social media platform to provide a clear and conspicuous button that enables the user to delete their account and provide the user with the necessary steps to delete the user’s account and personal information if the user clicks on that button, in accordance with specified procedures. The bill would prohibit a social media platform from obstructing or interfering with a user’s ability to delete their account, as specified. The bill would provide that a user’s request to delete an account constitutes a request to delete the consumer’s personal information under the CCPA.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1. The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Research demonstrates that adolescent individuals are at greater risk of developing addictive disorders.
(b) Further, excessive use of digital and social media has a documented connection to increases in suicide-related outcomes in teenagers and children, such as suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts.
(c) According to the University of Chicago, “[f]irst, account deletion options vary considerably across platforms and the language used to describe these options is not always clear. Most platforms offer account deletion on desktop browsers but not all allow account deletion from mobile apps or browsers. Second, we found evidence of several dark patterns present in the account deletion interfaces and platform policies. Third, most participants had tried to delete at least one social media account, yet over one-third of deletion attempts were never completed.”
(d) Adolescents seeking to terminate an account that has become a source of addiction should be able to terminate their account without obstruction.
(e) For all of these reasons, the Legislature declares it necessary in order to preserve the peace, welfare, and lives of its residents to ensure a minimum level of customer service when users wish to delete their accounts.
SEC. 2. Title 25 (commencing with Section 3273.90) is added to Part 4 of Division 3 of the Civil Code, to read:

(2) If the social media platform seeks verification of the request to delete the account, that verification shall be done in a cost-effective and easy-to-use manner when the request in paragraph (1) is submitted through preestablished two-factor authentication, email, text message, telephone call, or message.
