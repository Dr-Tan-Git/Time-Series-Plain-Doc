The rules referred to in the first and second clauses of this subsection shall also apply to the disclosure of summary data on indebtedness in connection with the preparation of broader credit ratings.  
(4) Summary data on the indebtedness of individuals may be disclosed only in such a manner that the data cannot form the basis for assessment of the financial standing and creditworthiness of other persons than the individuals concerned.  
24. Any personal data or credit ratings which turn out to be inaccurate or misleading shall be rectified or erased without delay.

25. Where any data or credit ratings which turn out to be inaccurate or misleading have already been disclosed, the agency shall immediately give written notification of the rectification to the data subject and to any third party who has received the data or the credit rating during the six months immediately preceding the date when the agency became aware of the matter. The data subject shall also be notified of any third party that has been notified under clause 1 of this section, and of the source of the personal data or credit rating.

26. - (1) Where a data subject requests the erasure, rectification or blocking of data or credit assessments which are alleged to be inaccurate or misleading, or requests the erasure of personal data which may not be processed, cf. section 37 (1), the agency shall reply in writing without delay and within 4 weeks from receipt of such a request.

27. - (1) Transfer to a third country of data may take place only if the third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection, cf. however subsection (3).

(2) The adequacy of the level of protection afforded by a third country shall be assessed in the light of all the circumstances surrounding a data transfer operation, in particular the nature of the data, the purpose and duration of the processing operation, the country of origin and country of final destination, the rules of law in force in the third country in question and the professional rules and security measures which are complied with in that country;  
(3) In addition to the cases mentioned in subsection (1), transfer of data to a third country may take place on condition that:

1. the data subject has given his explicit consent; or  
2. the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the data subject and the controller or the implementation of precontractual measures taken in response to the data subject's request; or  
3. the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in the interest of the data subject between the controller and a third party; or

(4) Outside the scope of the transfers referred to in subsection (3), the Data Protection Agency may authorise a transfer of personal data to a third country which does not comply with the provisions laid down in subsection (1), where the controller adduces adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of the rights of the data subject. More detailed conditions may be laid down for the transfer. The Data Protection Agency shall inform the European Commission and the other Member States of the authorisations that it grants pursuant to this provision.
