# EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

These Regulations make amendments to legislation in relation to the regulation of the processing of personal data.

These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers in sections 11(1) and 15(1) of, and paragraph 1 of Schedule 3 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2019 ("the EUWA 2019"), in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 11(2)(a), (b), (d) and (g)) arising from the withdrawal of Gibraltar from the European Union ("EU").

These Regulations also exercise powers in section 184 of the Data Protection Act 2004 ("the DPA 2004") to make provision consequential to that Act.

Regulations 1 to 3 cover title, commencement, and interpretation.

Regulation 4 introduces Schedule 1, which amends Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council ("the GDPR") as it forms part of Gibraltar law by virtue of section 6 of the EUWA 2019.

Regulation 5 introduces Schedule 2, which amends the DPA 2004.

Among other things, changes made by Schedules 1 and 2 have the effect of merging two preexisting regimes for the regulation of the processing of personal data – namely that established by the GDPR as supplemented by Chapter 2 of Part II of the DPA 2004 as originally enacted, and that established in Chapter 3 of Part II of the DPA 2004 as originally enacted (“the applied GDPR”). The applied GDPR extended GDPR standards to certain processing out of scope of EU law and the GDPR.

Regulation 6 makes provision concerning interpretation in relation to processing that prior to IP completion day was subject to the applied GDPR.

Regulation 7 introduces Schedule 3, which makes amendments to other legislation. Part 1 of Schedule 3 revokes certain EU data protection law that forms part of Gibraltar law by virtue of section 6 of the EUWA 2019. Part 2 of Schedule 3 makes amendments to other legislation consequential to the amendments made in Schedules 1 and 2. Part 3 of Schedule 3 makes general provision for references to the GDPR (that are not otherwise amended by Part 2) to have effect as references to the Gibraltar GDPR on and after IP completion day. Part 4 of Schedule 3 makes supplementary provision in respect of Parts 2 and 3.

Regulation 8 makes amendments to the Communications (Personal Data and Privacy) Regulations 2006, in light of provision made by the GDPR relating to the meaning of "consent".
