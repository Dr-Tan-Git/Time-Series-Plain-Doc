If a request from a consumer is manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repetitive, the controller may charge the consumer a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying with the request or may decline to act on the request. The controller bears the burden of demonstrating that a request is manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repetitive.  
(5) If a controller is unable to authenticate the request using commercially reasonable efforts, the controller is not required to comply with a consumer request submitted under section 7 of this act and may request that the consumer provide additional information reasonably necessary to authenticate the consumer's identity and the consumer's request.

(3) A controller shall inform the consumer in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to an appeal under this section not later than the sixtieth day after the date of receipt of the appeal, including a written explanation of the reason or reasons for the decision.

Sec. 11. (1) A controller shall establish two or more secure and reliable methods to enable a consumer to submit a request to exercise consumer rights under the Data Privacy Act. The methods shall take into account:

(a) The ways in which consumers normally interact with the controller;  
(b) The necessity for secure and reliable communications of those requests; and  
(c) The ability of the controller to authenticate the identity of the consumer making the request.  
(2) A controller shall not require a consumer to create a new account to exercise a consumer right under the Data Privacy Act, but may require a consumer to use an existing account.

(4) A controller that operates exclusively online and has a direct relationship with a consumer from whom the controller collects personal information is only required to provide an email address for the submission of a request described by subsection (3) of this section.  
(5) A consumer may designate another person to serve as the consumer's authorized agent and act on the consumer's behalf to opt out of the processing of the consumer's personal data under subdivisions (2) (e)(i) and (ii) of section 7 of this act. A consumer may designate an authorized agent using a technology, including a link to an Internet website, an Internet browser setting or extension, or a global setting on an electronic device, that allows the consumer to indicate the consumer's intent to opt out of the processing of the consumer's personal data under subdivisions (2)(e)(i) and (ii) of section 7 of this act. A controller shall comply with an opt-out request received from an authorized agent under this subsection if the controller is able to verify, with commercially reasonable effort, the identity of the consumer and the authorized agent's authority to act on the consumer's behalf. A controller is not required to comply with an opt-out request received

from an authorized agent under this subsection if:

(a) The authorized agent does not communicate the request to the controller in a clear and unambiguous manner;

(b) The controller is not able to verify, with commercially reasonable effort, that the consumer is a resident of this state;

Sec. 12. (1) A controller:

(a) Shall limit the collection of personal data to what is adequate, relevant, and reasonably necessary in relation to the purposes for which that personal data is processed, as disclosed to the consumer; and

(b) For purposes of protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of personal data, shall establish, implement, and maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical data security practices that are appropriate to the volume and nature of the personal data at issue.

(2) A controller shall not:

(a) Except as otherwise provided in the Data Privacy Act, process personal data for a purpose that is neither reasonably necessary to nor compatible with the disclosed purpose for which the personal data is

processed, as disclosed to the consumer, unless the controller obtains the consumer's consent;  
(b) Process personal data in violation of state and federal laws that prohibit unlawful discrimination against consumers;

(iii) Make available to the controller, on reasonable request, all information in the processor's possession necessary to demonstrate the processor's compliance with the requirements of the Data Privacy Act;  
(iv) Allow, and cooperate with, reasonable assessments by the controller or the controller's designated assessor; and  
(v) Engage any subcontractor pursuant to a written contract that requires the subcontractor to meet the requirements of the processor with respect to the personal data.

The processor shall provide a report of the assessment to the controller on request.  
(4) This section shall not be construed to relieve a controller or a processor from the liabilities imposed on the controller or processor by virtue of the role of the controller or processor in the processing relationship as described in the Data Privacy Act.

(5) A determination of whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that depends on the context in which personal data is to be processed. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data remains in the role of a processor.

Sec. 16. (1) A controller shall conduct and document a data protection assessment of each of the following processing activities involving personal data:

(a) The processing of personal data for purposes of targeted advertising;  
(b) The sale of personal data;  
(c) The processing of personal data for purposes of profiling, if the profiling presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of:  
(i) Unfair or deceptive treatment of or unlawful disparate impact on any consumer;  
(ii) Financial, physical, or reputational injury to any consumer;  
(iii) A physical or other intrusion on the solitude or seclusion, or the private affairs or concerns, of any consumer, if the intrusion would be offensive to a reasonable person; or

(d) The processing of sensitive data; and  
(e) Any processing activity that involves personal data that presents a heightened risk of harm to any consumer.  
(2) A data protection assessment conducted under subsection (1) of this section shall:  
(a) Identify and weigh the direct or indirect benefits that may flow from the processing to the controller, the consumer, other stakeholders, and the public, against the potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with that processing, as mitigated by safeguards that can be employed by the controller to reduce the risks; and

(b) Factor into the assessment:

(i) The use of deidentified data;

(ii) The reasonable expectations of consumers;

(iii) The context of the processing; and

(iv) The relationship between the controller and the consumer whose personal data will be processed.

(3) A controller shall make a data protection assessment requested under subsection (2) of section 21 of this act available to the Attorney General pursuant to a civil investigative demand under section 21 of this act.

(4) A data protection assessment is confidential and exempt from disclosure as a public record pursuant to sections 84-712 to 84-712.09. Disclosure of a data protection assessment in compliance with a request from the Attorney General does not constitute a waiver of attorney-client privilege or work-product protection with respect to the assessment and any information contained in the assessment.

(5) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of processing operations that include similar activities.

(6) A data protection assessment conducted by a controller for the purpose of compliance with other laws or regulations may constitute compliance with the requirements of this section if the assessment has a reasonably comparable scope and effect.

Sec. 17. (1) A controller in possession of deidentified data shall:

(a) Take reasonable measures to ensure that the data cannot be associated with an individual;  
(b) Publicly commit to maintaining and using deidentified data without attempting to reidentify the data; and  
(c) Contractually obligate any recipient of the deidentified data to comply with the Data Privacy Act.

(a) Reidentify deidentified data or pseudonymous data;  
(b) Maintain data in identifiable form or obtain, retain, or access any data or technology for the purpose of allowing the controller or processor to associate a consumer request with personal data; or  
(c) Comply with an authenticated consumer rights request under section 7 of this act, if the controller:  
(i) Is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the personal data or it would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate the request with the personal data;  
(ii) Does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the specific consumer who is the subject of the personal data or associate the personal data with other personal data about the same specific consumer; and  
(iii) Does not sell the personal data to any third party or otherwise voluntarily disclose the personal data to any third party other than a processor, except as otherwise permitted by this section.  
(3) The consumer rights under subdivisions (2)(a) through (d) of section 7 of this act and controller duties under section 12 of this act do not apply to pseudonymous data in any case in which the controller is able to demonstrate any information necessary to identify the consumer is kept separately and is subject to effective technical and organizational controls that prevent the controller from accessing the information.  
(4) A controller that discloses pseudonymous data or deidentified data shall exercise reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with any contractual commitments to which the pseudonymous data or deidentified data is subject and shall take appropriate steps to address any breach of the contractual commitments.  
Sec. 18. (1) A person described by subdivision (1)(c) of section 3 of this act shall not engage in the sale of personal data that is sensitive data without receiving prior consent from the consumer.  
(2) A person who violates this section is subject to the penalty

under section 24 of this act.

Sec. 21. (1) If the Attorney General has reasonable cause to believe that a controller or processor has engaged in or is engaging in a violation of the Data Privacy Act, the Attorney General may issue a civil investigative demand pursuant to section 23 of this act.

(2) The Attorney General may request, pursuant to a civil investigative demand, that a controller disclose any data protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the Attorney General. The Attorney General may evaluate the data protection assessment for compliance with sections 12 to 14 of this act.

Sec. 22.

(3) A loan made within lending limits at the initial time the loan was made may be renewed, extended, or serviced without regard to changes in the lending limit of a bank following the initial extension of the loan if (a) the renewal, extension, or servicing of the loan does not

(4) Any bank may purchase or take an interest in life insurance contracts for any purpose incidental to the business of banking. A bank's purchase of any life insurance contract, as measured by its cash surrender value, from any one life insurance company shall not at any time exceed twenty-five percent of the paid-up capital, surplus, and capital notes and debentures of such bank or fifteen percent of the unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus of such bank, whichever is greater. A bank's purchase of life insurance contracts, as measured by their cash surrender values, in the aggregate from all life insurance companies shall not at any time exceed thirty-five percent of the paid-up capital, surplus, undivided profits, and capital notes and debentures of such bank.

Any automatic teller machine owned by a nonfinancial institution third party shall be sponsored by an establishing financial institution. Neither such automatic teller machines nor the transactions conducted thereat shall be construed as the establishment of a branch or as branch banking.

(2) Any financial institution may become a user financial

institution by agreeing to pay the establishing financial institution the automatic teller machine usage fee. Such agreement shall be implied by the use of such automatic teller machines.

(3)(a)(i) All automatic teller machines shall be made available on a nondiscriminating basis for use by Nebraska customers of a user financial institution and (ii) all Nebraska automatic teller machine transactions initiated by Nebraska customers of a user financial institution shall be made on a nondiscriminating basis.

(c) The director, upon notice and after a hearing, may terminate or suspend the use of any automatic teller machine if he or she determines that the automatic teller machine is not made available on a nondiscriminating basis or that Nebraska automatic teller machine

transactions initiated at such automatic teller machine are not made on a nondiscriminating basis.

(e) The director, upon notice and after a hearing, may terminate or suspend the operation of any switch with respect to all Nebraska automatic teller machine transactions if he or she determines that the switch is not being operated in the manner required under subdivision (3) (d) of this section.  
(f) Subject to the requirement for a financial institution to comply with this subsection, no user financial institution or establishing financial institution shall be required to become a member of any particular switch.  
(4) Any consumer initiating an electronic funds transfer at an automatic teller machine for which an automatic teller machine surcharge will be imposed shall receive notice in accordance with the provisions of 15 U.S.C. 1693b(d)(3)(A) and (B), as such section existed on January 1, 2024 2023.

(5) A point-of-sale terminal may be established at any point within this state by a financial institution, a group of two or more financial

institutions, or a combination of a financial institution or financial institutions and a third party or parties. Such parties may contract with a seller of goods and services or any other third party for the operation of point-of-sale terminals.

(6) A seller of goods and services or any other third party on whose premises one or more point-of-sale terminals are established shall not be, solely by virtue of such establishment, a financial institution and shall not be subject to the laws governing, or other requirements imposed on, financial institutions, except for the requirement that it faithfully perform its obligations in connection with any transaction originated at any point-of-sale terminal on its premises.  
(7) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit nonbank employees from assisting in transactions originated at automatic tellermachines or point-of-sale terminals, and such assistance shall not be deemed to be engaging in the business of banking.

located outside of the State of Nebraska which are established by out-of-state financial institutions or foreign financial institutions or to allow customers of out-of-state financial institutions or foreign financial institutions to use its automatic teller machines. Such participation and any automatic teller machine usage fees charged or received pursuant to the national automatic teller machine program or usage fees charged for the use of its automatic teller machines by customers of out-of-state financial institutions or foreign financial institutions shall not be considered for purposes of determining (a) if an automatic teller machine has been made available or Nebraska automatic teller machine transactions have been made on a nondiscriminating basis for use by Nebraska customers of a user financial institution or (b) if a switch complies with subdivision (3)(d) of this section.

(11) An agreement to operate or share an automatic teller machine may not prohibit, limit, or restrict the right of the operator or owner of the automatic teller machine to charge a customer conducting a transaction using an account from a foreign financial institution an access fee or surcharge not otherwise prohibited under state or federal law.  
(12) Switch fees shall not be subject to this section or be regulated by the department.

Such participation and any automatic teller machine usage fees associated with Nebraska automatic teller machine

transactions initiated by customers of participating credit unions at such automatic teller machines shall not be considered for purposes of determining if such automatic teller machines have been made available on a nondiscriminating basis or if Nebraska automatic teller machine transactions initiated at such automatic teller machines have been made on a nondiscriminating basis, provided that all Nebraska automatic teller machine transactions initiated by customers of participating credit unions result in the same automatic teller machine usage fees for essentially the same service routed over the same switch.

(f) Essentially the same service means the same Nebraska automatic teller machine transaction offered by an establishing financial institution irrespective of the user financial institution, the Nebraska customer of which initiates the Nebraska automatic teller machine transaction.

If the latter procedure is followed, the new credit union shall be organized under the Credit Union Act or under the laws of the United States. All participating credit unions other than the continuing or new credit union shall be designated as merging credit unions.

(3) Any merger or consolidation of credit unions shall be done according to a plan of merger or consolidation. After approval by the boards of directors of all participating credit unions, the plan shall be submitted to the department for preliminary approval.

(4) After the department grants preliminary approval, each merging credit union, except the continuing credit union, shall, unless waived by the department, conduct a membership vote on its participation in the plan. The vote shall be conducted either at a special meeting called for that purpose or by mail ballot. If a majority of the members voting approve the plan, the credit union shall submit a record of that fact to the department indicating the vote by which the members approved the plan and either the time and place of the membership meeting or the mailing date and closing date of the mail ballot.

If the plan of merger or consolidation includes the organization of a new credit union, the department must approve the organization of the new credit union under section 21-1724 as part of the approval of the plan of merger or consolidation. The department shall notify all participating credit unions of the plan.

(7) Upon final approval of the plan by the department, all property, property rights, and members' interests in each merging credit union shall vest in the continuing or new credit union as applicable without deed, obligations, and other instruments of transfer, and all debts, obligations, and liabilities of each merging credit union shall be deemed
