To obtain a definitive authorization, they shall enclose all the documents that the laws and regulations require for the establishment of a branch of a foreign stock corporation.

The Superintendent shall examine the company’s by-laws in order to determine that nothing contained therein is against the Chilean laws, and shall investigate, in addition, for all the means he may deem convenient, if the company is an entity that offers an adequate guarantee in order to be granted the relevant authorization without an undue risk.

The authorization may be revoked at any time if the representative office does not comply with this provision or if its maintenance were considered inconvenient.

Article 34. Foreign banks authorized to operate in Chile shall enjoy the same rights as the Chilean banks in the same class and shall generally be subject to the same legal and regulatory provisions, except otherwise been expressly provided by law.

Any controversy that may arise with regard to the transactions executed by the branch in the country, irrespective of its nature, shall be decided upon by the Chilean courts, in accordance with the laws of the Republic.

If the shares so acquired shall have been registered in the bank’s Shareholders Register, or the ownership of the shares or rights in the company holder of the shares in the bank shall have been transferred, as the case may be, the Superintendency shall declare the exclusion of the voting rights and shall communicate its decision to the bank for its compliance with and the corresponding annotation in the Shareholders Register.

It shall be a requirement, in order to enjoy the extension, to have written off the value of the properties from the books of accounts.

The infraction of the prohibition established in this paragraph shall be punished with a fine equal to the value of the properties acquired. To the bank that does not dispose of such properties within the period and in the manner it may correspond, a fine equivalent to $1 0 ~ \%$ of the acquisition value, adjusted in accordance with the rules established by the Superintendency, shall be imposed for each calendar month they are maintained.

This prohibition shall not apply to gold, whether in coins or bullion.

The infraction of the provision in this paragraph shall render the act null and void, without prejudice to the provisions of general applicability regarding monetary sanctions.

The bank that is punished with a fine in accordance with this article shall have to conform to the corresponding margin within a period not to exceed from ninety days, counted from the date in which the notice of the violation is effected. Should it fail to do so, it may become eligible for any of the sanctions indicated in article 19.

Article 85. In order to determine the limit to which the loans to the same person may reach in accordance with the provisions in article 84, No. 1 and 4, the following rules shall apply:

b) If the participation in a corporation is higher than $2 \%$ and does not exceed $5 0 \%$ of the capital or profits, the inclusion shall be effected proportionate to that participation.

c) In the case of plurality of debtors of the same obligation, this shall be considered to be a joint and several obligations with respect to each one of the debtors; unless it expressly appears that it only has the character of simply joint obligation.

1) To establish the rules regarding mortgage secured loans through the issuance of mortgage funding notes.   
2) Establish the limits to the banks for the acquisition of mortgage funding notes for their own account.   
3) Establish rules regarding the redemption of mortgage funding notes when the guarantee is not timely constituted or when the debtors are at default and the guarantee has materially devaluated.

Article 93. The proceeds of the loans through mortgage funding notes which are granted for building purposes or for the construction of works destined to the improved agricultural or industrial exploitation of the real property shall be delivered through successive installments, to the extent of the works progress, and the basis for the operation shall be constituted by the value of the land and the cost of the works and of the improvements of a permanent nature affixed to it.

Article 94. The mortgage funding notes shall be issued forming series. There shall belong to a series those that accrue the same interest, have equal amortization and have been issued in identical currency.

The mortgage funding notes issued by the banks may be adjustable or not, and may be issued in registered or to the bearer form. If they are issued in registered form, their transfer shall be effected by means of the transfer of the certificate of title, executed by the assignor and the assignee, registered in a special register that the bank shall maintain for this purpose. The type and division of the notes shall be determined by the issuing institution.

Article 95. The persons that shall contract loans through mortgage funding notes shall undertake to repay them in the installments paid in advance determined in the contract, which shall be inclusive of amortization, interest and a management fee.

Article 96. The banks shall not issue mortgage funding notes but in the amount represented by the respective mortgage obligations constituted in their favor.

The mortgage funding notes issued shall be recorded in a register to be maintained by each issuing institution, conforming to that effect to the rules to be enacted by the Superintendency.

In the case of mortgage funding notes of indirect amortization, the payment of interest shall be effected on the stated maturity dates, and the amortization shall be effected by purchase, redemption or lottery at nominal value, as it may deem it convenient, of mortgage funding notes for a nominal value equivalent to the sinking fund corresponding to the respective period.

In the event of a lottery, the mortgage funding notes that must be amortized in each period shall be determined by casting lots in the preceding period.

Every lottery or incineration of mortgage funding notes shall be effected before a notary public.

In the case of mortgage funding notes drawn by lot, the banks shall not refuse payment of the principal thereof, or the adjustment or interest, nor shall the opposition of a third party be admitted for its payment, unless, in the case of mortgage funding notes issued in a registered form, the latter alleges the lost of the same mortgage funding note, the collection of whose amortization or interest is being sought.

Every mortgage funding note drawn by lot ceases to be subject to adjustment and accrue interest since the day scheduled for its amortization.

Article 98. The amortization of the mortgage funding notes may be effected in an ordinary manner, either directly or indirectly, or in an extraordinary manner.

The extraordinary amortization also takes place when the debtor makes an early payment of the whole or any part of his debt by means of the delivery of mortgage funding notes. These notes shall be received at the value stated in the title, after deduction of the partial amortization thereof, or, in the case of mortgage funding notes whose coupons include only the payment of interest, at their nominal value.

Article 99. The loans in mortgage funding notes shall be secured by first degree mortgage rights, which mortgage rights shall not be extended to secure other obligations with the bank.

Article 100. The debtor of loans in mortgage funding notes may extraordinarily repay the whole or any part of the outstanding principal of his debt, either in cash or mortgage funding notes of the same series of that of the loan and whose non-amortized nominal value corresponds to the whole or the portion of the loan being paid.

In these cases, in order to be definitely released from all obligations to the bank for the principal or the portion of the principal being repaid, the debtor shall be obligated to pay the interest and management fee corresponding to a period of amortization of the mortgage funding notes of his loan for all the amount for which an early payment has been made.

Article 101. The total or partial extraordinary payment made voluntarily by the debtor may be effected at any time, with the exception of the months in which the lotteries must be conducted.

Article 102. If the mortgaged property shall experience detriment or suffers damage in such a manner that it does not offer sufficient guarantee for the security of the loan, the bank shall have the right to request its repayment. When the losses or detriments affecting the property may not be attributed to the negligence of the debtor, the bank shall demand a new guarantee or an increased guarantee for its loan.

Article 103. When the debtors shall have not satisfied the payment of the installments within the stipulated period, and having such payment been demanded through the courts, they have not paid them within the period of ten days, the judge shall order, upon the bank’s petition, the sale of the mortgaged property in public auction, or its surrender in “praetorian pledge” to the creditor bank, in order for the latter to apply to the payment of the amount owed the benefits the property may yield.

The debtor shall have the right to oppose, within the period of five days, to the sale in public auction or its surrender in “praetorian pledge”. The opposition shall only be admitted when grounded in any of the following objections:

1) Payment of the debt;   
2) Prescription;   
3) Non-applicability of the action to the defendant.

By virtue of this last objection it shall not possible to argue the existence of the obligation, and, in order for it to be admitted, it shall have to be grounded in a written evidence and to appear based upon a credible foundation. Should these requirements not be present, the court shall forthwith dismiss it.

The opposition shall be handled in accordance with the procedure established for the incidents.

The appeals of the resolutions pronounced against the defendant in these proceedings shall not interrupt the progress of the lawsuit. The higher court shall be entitled to decree, at the request of the party, the suspension of the enforcement of the judgment pronounced by the court of first instance while the appeal is pending if there exist grounded reason for doing so, which resolution shall be adopted without any formalities.

If an opposition is not filed or, upon dismissal of the opposition filed, the mortgaged property shall be sold in public auction or surrendered in “praetorian pledge” to the bank , as the case may be.

Article 104. Upon surrender of the property in “praetorian pledge” to the bank, the bank shall receive all rents, income or fruit yielded by the property, irrespective of the person upon whom the possession thereof may be vested, and after payment of the real property taxes, administration expenses and senior liens, shall apply them to the payment of the amounts owed, keeping an account to reimburse the balance to the debtor, should there be any. At any time in which the debtor makes payment of the amounts owed to the bank, the real property shall be restored to him.

Once the public auction has been decreed, same shall be communicated by means of notices published for four times in different days and with a lapse of twenty days, at least, between the first notice and the day of the auction, in a newspaper of the department in which the proceedings are conducted and, should there not be any, in a newspaper of the capital of the corresponding province. The notices may be published both in business days as well as in non-business days.

In the day the public auction takes place, the property shall be awarded to the bidder submitting the higher offer. The bank shall make payment of its loan from the proceeds of the auction.

The minimum and other conditions for the public auction shall be established by the judge without any right of appeal, at the bank’s proposal; but the minimum of the first auction may not be less than the principal owed, overdue installments, default interest, legal expenses and insurance premiums that may burden the debt. The legal expenses shall be determined by the judge.

Whenever a new auction becomes necessary, the number of notices and the period to lapse between the first publication and the date of the auction shall be reduced by half.

Article 105. If, in addition to the bank, other creditors shall have mortgage rights on the same real property, the resolution surrendering to the bank in “praetorian pledge” the real property, or the one ordering the sale in public auction, shall be notified to them. Should those mortgage creditors have a right senior to that of the bank, they shall enjoy their preferred right to receive payment from whatever the real property yields in the event of surrender in “praetorian pledge”, and without prejudice thereof, or from the proceeds of the sale of the property, in the event of a sale in public auction.

The creditors shall be notified personally with respect to the first auction and thereafter by means of a notice sent by mail to the same place where the first notice to them was effected, unless they have designated in the proceedings a special domicile.

The credits of the State and the Municipalities shall enjoy the preference conferred in articles 2,472 and 2,478 of the Civil Code with respect to the bank’s loans only when they originate from taxes directly affecting the mortgaged property, and that have as their basis the assessed value of the real property, and of credits in favor of paving services, in accordance with the respective laws.

Article 106. The successful bidders of real properties in proceedings regulated by the procedure set forth in this statute shall not be obligated to maintain the leases to which they may be affected, unless these have been executed by means of a public deed registered in the respective Registrar of Real Properties prior to the creation of mortgage rights in favor of the bank or authorized by the latter.

The provisions in subparagraphs 3 and 4 of article 1,464 of the Civil Code shall not apply in the cases of the transfers of properties effected in these proceedings, and the judge shall forthwith order the cancellation of the interdictions and prohibitions affecting the transferred property, even if ordered by other courts.

In these cases, the balances resulting after the bank and the other mortgage creditors have been paid, shall remain deposited to the order of the judge before whom the action is being tried, to secure the interdictions and prohibitions decreed by other courts and which would have been canceled by virtue of the provision in the preceding paragraph.

Article 107. The procedure indicated in this statute shall apply both in the case of a lawsuit for collection against the bank’s direct debtor as well as in the cases contemplated in articles 1,377 of the Civil Code and 758 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

The arrangement proposed by the board of directors shall be qualified by the Superintendency as to its effects in the actual improvement of the financial institution and, especially, as to whether or not the remission of part of the debts that has been proposed is essential. The Superintendency shall issue its opinion within the period of five business days and, upon failure to do so, the arrangement shall be proposed to the creditors. If the

Superintendency formulates objections, the board of directors shall have two business days to accept them.

There shall have the right to vote the arrangement those creditors whose credits appear in the list referred to in the preceding article, as well as those creditors whose credits have been acknowledged by the entity, at the request of the holder, prior to the commencement of the voting process. Any discrepancy that may arise due to the inclusion in the list of the names of persons who were not creditors, or the omission of those who did have such capacity, or in connection with the amount of the credit, shall be administratively resolved by the Superintendency no later than the second day preceding the expiration of the voting period.

For information purposes only, the creditors residing abroad, in addition to be included in the list, shall be provided notice by telex, cable or any other equivalent means, addressed to the domicile registered with the institution.

Article 126. Whenever the mortgage credits of Title XIII are transferred in accordance with the provisions in this Title, the acquiring bank shall become obligated to the payment, either fully or partially, of the mortgage funding notes, all that subject to a balance of the said credits and obligations.
