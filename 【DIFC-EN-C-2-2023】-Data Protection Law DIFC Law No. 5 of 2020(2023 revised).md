8.4.2 Party A must reasonably attempt to identify and notify the party/ies that were previously in control or possession of the Inadvertently Obtained Information (individually or collectively "Party B") and, if successful in doing so, requesting that the same be removed or accepted by Party B within a period of thirty (30) days.  
8.4.3 Where Party B positively responds to a notice provided under Regulation 8.4.2 and removes the Inadvertently Obtained Information from Party A's control or possession within thirty (30) days, Party A shall take reasonable steps to ensure that the Inadvertently Obtained Information is completely expunged from its records and, in such circumstances, any notification responsibility in relation to a Personal Data Breach related to the Inadvertently Obtained Information coming into the control or possession of Party A under Article 41 of the Law shall be that of Party B.  
8.4.4 Where Party B is unreachable, unidentifiable or does not recover the Inadvertently Obtained Information from Party A within thirty (30) days after being notified pursuant to Regulation 8.4.2, Party A shall:

(a) notify the Commissioner of the same and provide possession or control of the Inadvertently Obtained Information to the Commissioner;

(a) impose sanctions or remedies against Party B, or any relevant Controller, in accordance with the Law and these Regulations in respect of such Personal Data Breach;  
(b) direct Party B, or any relevant Controller, to communicate in respect of such Personal Data Breach in the manner prescribed in Regulation 8.3;  
(c) direct or suggest actions to Party B, or any other relevant person, in terms of what needs to be done by it in respect of the Inadvertently Obtained Information; and  
(d) order Party B to pay the costs related to storage, access, assessment, disposal or any other treatment considered reasonable by the Commissioner of the contents of the Inadvertently Obtained Information, either directly or via court order where necessary.

8.4.6 Where Party A:

(a) fails to act in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation 8.4; or  
(b) in any way uses or disposes of Inadvertently Obtained Information for its own benefit,

such actions shall constitute a contravention under Article 61 of the Law and the Commissioner may issue directions, impose fines or seek sanctions or remedies against Party A pursuant to Parts 9 and 10 of the Law where it is necessary and proportionate to do so.

8.4.7 Party A may seek costs from Party B for expenses related to the storage, assessment, disposal or other treatment of the contents of the Inadvertently Obtained Information, either directly or via court order where necessary.

# 10.3 General Requirements for Autonomous and Semi-Autonomous Systems

10.3.1 A System developed and utilised in products, services, or other use cases that may impact a Data Subject, negatively or positively, must be designed in accordance with the following concepts:9

(a) Ethical: algorithmic decisions and the associated data lineage of a System should be unbiased and mitigated. This principle is closely linked with the principles of fairness and transparency.  
(b) Fairness: Systems should be designed to treat all individuals equally and fairly, regardless of race, gender, or other specifically subjective factors. Additionally, Systems should be designed to avoid potential biases, including unjust bias, or where possible, mitigate bias that could lead to unfair outcomes.

(e) Accountability: a System must have mechanisms in place to ensure responsibility and accountability for enabling its Systems and outcomes. Such mechanisms may include internal governance and control frameworks in place for monitoring the System, processes and projects regularly or external organisation auditing processes regularly, enabling the assessment of algorithms, data and design processes.

# 10.3.4 For the purposes of Regulation 10 and the Law:12

(a) a Deployer of a System shall be deemed to act as a Controller (or, mutatis mutandis, a Joint Controller) in respect of the Processing of Personal Data by that System; and
