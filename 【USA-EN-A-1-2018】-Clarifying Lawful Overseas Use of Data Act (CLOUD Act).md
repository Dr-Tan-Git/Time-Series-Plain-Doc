# DIVISION V-CLOUD ACT

# SEC. 101. SHORT TITLE.

This division may be cited as the “Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act” or the “CLOUD Act”.

# SEC. 102. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) Timely access to electronic data held by communications-service providers is an essential component of government efforts to protect public safety and combat serious crime, including terrorism.  
(2) Such efforts by the United States Government are being impeded by the inability to access data stored outside the United States that is in the custody, control, or possession of communications-service providers that are subject to jurisdiction of the United States.  
(3) Foreign governments also increasingly seek access to electronic data held by communications-service providers in the United States for the purpose of combating serious crime.  
(4) Communications-service providers face potential conflicting legal obligations when a foreign government orders production of electronic data that

# 2202

United States law may prohibit providers from disclosing.  
(5) Foreign law may create similarly conflicting legal obligations when chapter 121 of title 18, United States Code (commonly known as the "Stored Communications Act"), requires disclosure of electronic data that foreign law prohibits communications-service providers from disclosing.  
(6) International agreements provide a mechanism for resolving these potential conflicting legal obligations where the United States and the relevant foreign government share a common commitment to the rule of law and the protection of privacy and civil liberties.

# 2207

“(E) the nature and extent of the provider’s ties to and presence in the United States;  
“(F) the importance to the investigation of the information required to be disclosed;  
“(G) the likelihood of timely and effective access to the information required to be disclosed through means that would cause less serious negative consequences; and  
“(H) if the legal process has been sought on behalf of a foreign authority pursuant to section 3512, the investigative interests of the foreign authority making the request for assistance.  
“(4) DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS DURING PENDENCY OF CHALLENGE.—A service provider shall preserve, but not be obligated to produce, information sought during the pendency of a motion brought under this subsection, unless the court finds that immediate production is necessary to prevent an adverse result identified in section 2705(a)(2).

6 wire or electronic communication of a customer or  
7 subscriber who is a national or resident of the quali

10 strued to modify or otherwise affect any other au  
11 thority to make a motion to modify or quash a pro  
12 tective order issued under section 2705".
