# (Constitutional provision)

# Fundamental right to data protection

§ 1. (1) Every person shall have the right to secrecy of the personal data concerning that person, especially with regard to the respect for his or her private and family life, insofar as that person has an interest which deserves such protection. Such an interest is precluded if data cannot be subject to the right to secrecy due to the data's general availability or because they cannot be traced back to the data subject.  
(2) Insofar as personal data are not used in the vital interest of the data subject or with the data subject's consent, restrictions of the right to secrecy are permitted only to safeguard overriding legitimate interests of another person, namely in the case of interference by a public authority only on the basis of laws which are necessary for the reasons stated in Article 8 para. 2 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR), Federal Law Gazette No 210/1958. Such laws may provide for the use of data that, due to their nature, deserve special protection only in order to safeguard substantial public interests and, at the same time, shall provide for adequate safeguards for the protection of the data subjects' interests in confidentiality. Even in the case of permitted restrictions, a fundamental right may only be interfered with using the least intrusive of all effective methods.  
(3) Insofar as personal data concerning a person are intended for automated processing or processing in files managed manually, i.e. files managed without automated processing, every person shall, as provided for by law, have

1. the right to obtain information as to who processes what data concerning the person, where the data originated from, for which purpose they are used, and in particular to whom the data are transmitted;

2. the right to rectification of incorrect data and the right to erasure of illegally processed data.

(4) Restrictions of the rights according to para. 3 are only permitted under the conditions laid out in para. 2.

(Note: para. 5 repealed by Federal Law Gazette I No 51/2012)

# Article 2

# Chapter 1 Implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation and supplementary provisions

# Part 1 General provisions

# Scope of application and implementing provision

$\S 4$ . (1) The provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), OJ No L 119 of 4 May 2016, p. 1 (in the following: General Data Protection Regulation) and this federal law shall apply to the processing of personal data of natural persons wholly or partly by automated means and to the processing other than by automated means of personal data of natural persons which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system, unless the more specific provisions of Chapter 3 of this federal law prevail.

(2) If personal data processed by automated means cannot be rectified or erased immediately because they can be rectified or erased only at certain times for economic or technical reasons, processing of the personal data concerned shall be restricted until that time, with the effect as stipulated in Article 18 para. 2 of the General Data Protection Regulation.

(3) Processing personal data on acts or omissions punishable by courts or administrative authorities, in particular concerning suspected criminal offences, as well as data on criminal convictions and precautionary measures involving the deprivation of liberty, is permitted if the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation are met and if

1. an explicit legal authorisation or obligation to process such data exists; or  
2. the legitimacy of the processing of such data is otherwise based on statutory duties of diligence, or processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party pursuant to Article 6 para. 1 (f) of the General Data Protection Regulation, and the manner in which the data are processed safeguards the interests of the data subject according the General Data Protection Regulation and this federal law.  
(4) In the case of an offer of information society services directly to a child, consent to the processing of the personal data of a child pursuant to Article 6 para. 1 (a) of the General Data Protection Regulation shall be lawful where the child is at least 14 years old.  
(5) Without prejudice to other statutory restrictions, data subjects shall not have a right of access pursuant to Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation in relation to a controller acting with public authority and powers if granting access put at risk performance of a task delegated to the controller by law.  
(6) Without prejudice to other statutory restrictions, data subjects shall not have a right of access pursuant to Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation in relation to a controller if granting access put at risk a trade or business secret of the controller or a third party.

(Note: para. 7 repealed by Article 5 subpara. 3, Federal Law Gazette I No 14/2019)

# Data protection officer

§ 5. (1) Without prejudice to other obligations of confidentiality, the data protection officer and the persons working for the data protection officer shall be

bound by confidentiality when fulfilling their duties. This shall apply in particular in relation to the identity of data subjects who applied to the data protection officer, and to circumstances that allow identification of these persons, unless the data subject has expressly granted a release from confidentiality. The data protection officer and the persons working for the data protection officer may exclusively use information made available to fulfil their duties and shall be bound by confidentiality even after the end of their activities.

(2) If, during his or her activities, a data protection officer obtains knowledge of data in respect of which a person employed with a body subject to the supervision of the data protection officer has a statutory right to refuse to give evidence, the data protection officer and the persons working for the data protection officers shall also have such a right to the extent to which the person who has the right to refuse to give evidence exercised that right. The files and other documents of the data protection officer are subject to a prohibition of seizure and confiscation to the extent of the right of the data protection officer to refuse to give evidence.  
(3) Public-sector data protection officers (established in a form provided by public law, in particular also as an officer of a territorial authority) are not bound by any instructions when exercising their duties. The highest governing bodies or officers have the right to obtain information on matters to be dealt with from a public-sector data protection officer. The data protection officer shall provide information only insofar as the independence of the data protection officer as described in Article 38 para. 3 of the General Data Protection Regulation is not impaired by doing so.  
(4) Considering the type and scope of data processing activities and depending on the facilities of a federal ministry, one or several data protection officers shall be appointed in the sphere of responsibilities of each federal ministry. These data protection officers shall be employed by the relevant federal ministry or the relevant subordinate office or other entity.  
(5) Public-sector data protection officers pursuant to para. 4 shall regularly exchange information, in particular with regard to ensuring uniform data protection standards.

# Confidentiality of data

§ 6. (1) The controller, the processor and their employees, i.e. employees and persons in a quasi-employee relationship, shall ensure the confidentiality of personal data from data processing activities that have been entrusted or have become

accessible to them solely due to their employment, without prejudice to other statutory obligations of confidentiality, unless a legitimate reason for the transmission of the data that have been entrusted or have become accessible to them exists (confidentiality of data).

(2) Employees may transmit personal data only if expressly ordered to do so by their employer. Unless such an obligation of their employees already exists by law, the controller and the processor shall contractually bind their employees to transmit personal data from data processing activities only on the basis of orders and to maintain the confidentiality of data even after the end of their employment with the controller or processor.  
(3) The controller and the processor shall inform the employees affected by these orders about the transmission orders applicable to them and about the consequences of a violation of data confidentiality.  
(4) Without prejudice to the right to give instructions under constitutional law, an employee must not incur any disadvantage from refusing to comply with an order for a prohibited transmission of data.  
(5) The statutory right of a controller to refuse to give evidence shall not be avoided by questioning a processor working for the controller, and in particular not by seizing or confiscating documents processed by automated means.

# Part 2 Data processing for specific purposes

# Processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes

$\S 7$ . (1) For archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes whose goal is not to obtain results in a form relating to specific data subjects, the controller may process all personal data that

1. are publicly accessible,  
2. the controller has lawfully collected for other research projects or other purposes, or  
3. are pseudonymised personal data for the controller, and the controller cannot establish the identity of the data subject by legal means.

(2) In the case of processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes that do not fall under para. 1, personal data may be processed only

1. pursuant to specific legal provisions,  
2. with the consent of the data subject, or  
3. with a permit of the Data Protection Authority pursuant to para. 3.

(3) A permit of the Data Protection Authority for the processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall be granted at the request of the controller ordering the research project, if

1. the consent of the data subject is impossible to obtain because the data subject cannot be reached or the effort would otherwise be unreasonable,  
2. there is a public interest in the processing for which a permit is sought, and  
3. the professional aptitude of the controller has been satisfactorily demonstrated.

If special categories of personal data (Article 9 of the General Data Protection Regulation) are to be collected, an important public interest in the research project must exist; furthermore, it must be ensured that the personal data are processed at the premises of the controller ordering the research project only by persons who are subject to a statutory obligation of confidentiality regarding the subject matter of the research project or whose reliability in this respect is credible. The Data Protection Authority shall issue the permit subject to terms and conditions, insofar as this is necessary to safeguard the data subjects' interests which deserve protection.

(4) A request according to para. 3 must, however, be accompanied by a statement signed by the person authorised to exercise rights in respect of the data files from which the personal data are to be collected, stating that this person is making the data files available for the research project. Instead of this statement, a writ of enforcement (§ 367 para. 1 of the Enforcement Code, Imperial Law Gazette No 79/1896) replacing this statement may be submitted.  
(5) Even in cases where the processing of personal data for scientific research purposes or statistical purposes is permitted in a form which allows the identification of data subjects, the data shall be coded without delay so that the data subjects are no longer identifiable if specific phases of scientific or statistical work can be performed with personal data pursuant to para. 1 subpara. 3. Unless otherwise expressly provided for by law, data in a form which allows the identification of data subjects shall be rendered unidentifiable as soon as it is no longer necessary for scientific or statistical work to keep them identifiable.  
(6) Legal restrictions on the right to use personal data for other reasons, in particular for copyright reasons, shall not be affected.

# Providing addresses to inform and interview data subjects

$\S 8$ . (1) Unless otherwise expressly provided for by law, providing address data of a certain group of data subjects in order to inform or interview them shall require the consent of the data subjects.  
(2) If, however, an infringement of the data subject's interests in confidentiality is unlikely, considering the selection criteria for the group of data subjects and the subject of the information or interview, no consent shall be required

1. if data from the same controller are processed, or  
2. in the case of an intended transfer of address data to third parties,

a) if there is also a public interest in the information or interview, or

b) if none of the data subjects, after having received appropriate information on the reason and content of the transfer, has objected to the transfer within a reasonable period.

(3) If the requirements of para. 2 are not met and if obtaining the consent of the data subjects pursuant to para. 1 would require a disproportionate effort, the transfer of the address data shall be permissible with a permit of the Data Protection Authority pursuant to para. 4 if the data are to be transferred to third parties

1. for the purpose of information or an interview due to an important interest of the data subject,  
2. due to an important public interest in the information or interview, or  
3. for an interview of the data subjects for scientific or statistical purposes.

(4) At the request of a controller processing address data, the Data Protection Authority shall grant the permit for their transfer if the controller has satisfactorily demonstrated that the requirements stipulated in para. 3 have been met and no overriding interests in confidentiality which deserve protection on the part of the data subjects represent an obstacle to the transfer. The Data Protection Authority shall issue the permit subject to terms and conditions, insofar as this is necessary to safeguard interests of the data subjects which deserve protection.

(5) The transferred address data shall only be processed for the permitted purpose and shall be erased as soon as they are no longer needed for information or interviews.  
(6) If it is lawful pursuant to the aforementioned provisions to transfer the names and addresses of persons belonging to a certain group of data subjects, the processing required for selecting the address data to be transferred shall also be permitted.

# Freedom of expression and information

$\S 9$ . (1) The provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation and of this federal law shall apply to the processing of personal data by media owners, editors, copy editors and employees of a media undertaking or a media service as defined in the Media Act, Federal Law Gazette No 314/1981, as well as by other persons who, on the basis of a contract, are engaged as journalists in contributing to editing the contents of a medium or editing the contents of the publications of a media service

in a media undertaking or media service for journalistic purposes of the media undertaking or media service with the following reservations:

1. The controller is not required to disclose to the data subject information subject to the protection of editorial confidentiality (editorial confidentiality under data protection law, § 31 of the Media Act); § 31 para. 2 of the Media Act shall be applied. In proceedings before courts and authorities having matters of data protection as their subject matter, § 31 of the Media Act shall apply with the reservation that the controller may refuse to answer questions as referred to in § 31 para. 1 of the Media Act not only as witnesses but also as any other person involved in the proceedings. § 321 para. 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, Imperial Law Gazette No 113/1895, shall be applied accordingly. In exercising its powers, the Data Protection Authority shall take into consideration the protection of editorial confidentiality.  
2. The controller is entitled to process personal data, including the special categories of personal data referred to in Article 9 para. 1 of the General Data Protection Regulation as well as personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures (Article 10 of the General Data Protection Regulation), provided that the processing is carried out for journalistic purposes. Article 10 last sentence of the General Data Protection Regulation shall remain unaffected. § 12 and § 13 of this federal law shall not be applicable.  
3. With regard to the principle of transparency, Article 5 para. 1 (a) of the General Data Protection Regulation shall apply with the reservation that the processing of personal data must be transparent for the data subject only insofar as the freedom of expression and information is not unreasonably impaired thereby and only insofar as the provisions of this paragraph do not provide otherwise.  
4. Articles 13 and 14 (Information to be provided) and Article 21 para. 1 (Right to object) of the General Data Protection Regulation shall not be applicable.  
5. The right of access (Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation) shall not be applicable in relation to personal data on the basis of which no publication has yet been made. In all other cases, the right of access (Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation) shall apply with the reservation that the data subject may request access only in relation to certain publications that must be specifically named in the request for

access, and the data subject must give reasons as to why and how the data subject is affected in each case, and the controller is entitled, by way of derogation from Article 12 para. 5 first sentence of the General Data Protection Regulation, to charge a fee of €9 for processing the request for access; if the data subject does not specifically name a publication, does not give reasons as to why and how the data subject is affected in each case or does not provide evidence of payment of the fee, the controller may refuse to act on the request. The controller is entitled to refuse access insofar as this is required and proportionate in individual cases to protect the freedom of expression and information; in such cases, the controller is not required to disclose to the data subject when answering the request for access whether or not the data subject's personal data have been processed, insofar as this would undermine the purpose of the refusal to provide access. The right to a copy (Article 15 para. 3 of the General Data Protection Regulation) is excluded.

6. Article 16 (Right to rectification), Article 17 (Right to erasure) and Article 18 (Right to restriction of processing) of the General Data Protection Regulation shall not be applied

a) in relation to personal data on the basis of which no publication has yet been made;  
b) in relation to personal data published in a medium as defined in  $\S 1$  para. 1 subpara. 1 of the Media Act;  
c) to the extent that there is a conflicting basis of a claim on the ground of the infringement of personality rights of the data subject under civil law, in particular pursuant to  $\S 20$  or  $\S 1330$  of the General Civil Code, Collection of Laws No 946/1811, or pursuant to  $\S 78$  of the Copyright Act, Federal Law Gazette I No 111/1936.

In all other cases, the controller is entitled, in case the data subject asserts the rights provided for in Articles 16 and 18 of the General Data Protection Regulation, to refuse rectification or restriction of processing insofar as this is required and proportionate in individual cases to protect the freedom of expression and information.

7. In the cases referred to in subpara. 5 second and third sentences, subpara. 6 second sentence and Article 17 para. 3 of the General Data Protection Regulation, the data subject is entitled to request a review by the Data Protection Authority of the lawfulness of the refusal of access, rectification,

restriction of processing or erasure. The controller shall inform the data subject about this right. If this right is exercised, the controller shall satisfactorily demonstrate that the requirements for such restriction have been met. § 25 para. 3 shall be applied with the reservation that the Data Protection Authority shall inform the data subject only about the fact that all necessary verifications or a review by the Data Protection Authority have taken place, unless the Data Protection Authority reaches the conclusion that the relevant restriction was not permitted. In addition, the Data Protection Authority shall inform the data subject about the data subject's right to lodge a complaint with the Federal Administrative Court.

8. To protect editorial confidentiality under data protection law, and insofar as this is required and proportionate to protect the freedom of expression and information, in particular with regard to subpara. 4 as well as to restrictions pursuant to subpara. 5, controllers as referred to in para. 1 first sentence as well as other controllers who, jointly with these controllers, process data for the purposes referred to in para. 1 first sentence, do not have an obligation of disclosure pursuant to Article 26 para. 2 second sentence of the General Data Protection Regulation.  
9. Article 33 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority) shall be applied with the reservation that the Data Protection Authority must be notified of a personal data breach only if the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Communication of a personal data breach to the data subject pursuant to Article 34 of the General Data Protection Regulation is required only in accordance with an order by the Data Protection Authority pursuant to Article 58 para. 1 (e) of the General Data Protection Regulation and provided that editorial confidentiality under data protection law is not adversely affected thereby.  
10. Article 38 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Position of the data protection officer) shall apply with the reservation that the controller or the processor may restrict access by the data protection officer to personal data processed for journalistic purposes insofar as this is required and proportionate to protect the freedom of expression and information.  
11. The controller and the processor are not required to comply with the provisions of Chapter V of the General Data Protection Regulation

(Transfers of personal data to third countries or international organisations). Without prejudice to Article 24 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Responsibility of the controller), the controller and the processor shall take appropriate measures to ensure that the data subject's rights and freedoms are not unreasonably impaired if personal data are transferred to third countries or international organisations.

12. Codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40 para. 2 of the General Data Protection Regulation may specify more details of restrictions pursuant to subpara. 5 third sentence and subpara. 6 second sentence as well as appropriate measures as referred to in subpara. 11 second sentence of this paragraph. In procedures pursuant to Article 40 para. 5 of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Data Protection Authority shall obtain an opinion by the Austrian Communications Authority ("KommAustria") ( $\S$  1 para. 1 of the KommAustria Act, Federal Law Gazette I No 32/2001) on a draft code of conduct or on a draft amendment or extension.

13. Article 56 (Competence of the lead supervisory authority) and Chapter VII of the General Data Protection Regulation (Cooperation and consistency) shall not be applicable.

(1a) Para. 1 subparas. 1, 4 and 13 shall apply to the processing of personal data for journalistic purposes not covered by para. 1; para. 1 subpara. 3 shall apply with the reservation that the reference refers to the provisions in para. 1 subparas. 1, 4 and 13 and para. 1a. The controller is entitled to process personal data revealing political opinions, or religious or philosophical beliefs (Article 9 para. 1 of the General Data Protection Regulation) as well as personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures (Article 10 of the General Data Protection Regulation) for the purposes of legitimate interests (Article 6 para. 1 (f) of the General Data Protection Regulation) insofar as this is required and proportionate to exercise the freedom of expression and information. Article 10 last sentence of the General Data Protection Regulation shall remain unaffected. Articles 16 (Right to rectification), 17 (Right to erasure) and 18 (Right to restriction of processing) of the General Data Protection Regulation shall not be applied in relation to personal data published in a medium as defined in § 1 para. 1 subpara. 1 of the Media Act. In all other cases, the controller is entitled to refuse access, rectification, erasure or restriction of processing in relation to personal data processed for journalistic purposes on the basis of which no publication has yet been

made, in case the rights referred to in Articles 15 to 18 of the General Data Protection Regulation are asserted by the data subject, insofar as this is required and proportionate in individual cases to protect the freedom of expression and information; § 25 para. 3 shall be applied. Codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40 para. 2 of the General Data Protection Regulation may specify more details of such restrictions. In procedures pursuant to Article 40 para. 5 of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Data Protection Authority shall obtain an opinion by KommAustria on a draft code of conduct or on a draft amendment or extension.

(2) If it is necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with the freedom of expression and information, Chapter II (principles), with the exception of Article 5, Chapter III (rights of the data subject), Chapter IV (controller and processor), with the exception of Articles 28, 29 and 32, Chapter V (transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations), Chapter VI (independent supervisory authorities), Chapter VII (cooperation and consistency) and Chapter IX (specific data processing situations) of the General Data Protection Regulation shall not apply to processing for the purposes of academic, artistic or literary expression. Of the provisions of this federal law, § 6 (confidentiality of data) shall be applied in such cases.

# Processing of personal data in case of emergency

§ 10. (1) In case of emergency, public-sector controllers and relief organisations shall be authorised to jointly process data to the extent that this is necessary to assist persons directly affected by a disaster, to locate and identify missing or deceased persons and to provide information to their relatives.

(2) Anybody who lawfully possesses personal data shall be permitted to transfer these data to public-sector controllers and relief organisations if these controllers and organisations need this personal data to manage a disaster for the purposes specified in para. 1.  
(3) The transfer abroad of personal data is permitted insofar as this is absolutely necessary to fulfil the purposes mentioned in para. 1. Data that by themselves would make the data subject liable to criminal prosecution shall not be transferred unless they are absolutely necessary for identification in a particular case. The Data Protection Authority shall be informed immediately about the data transfers

performed and about the circumstances of the motivating incident. The Data Protection Authority shall prohibit further data transfers if the interference with the fundamental right to data protection resulting from the data transfer is not justified by the special circumstances caused by a disaster.

(4) Based on a specific inquiry of a close relative of a person who has actually or presumably been directly affected by a disaster, controllers are authorised to transfer to the inquiring person personal data regarding the whereabouts of the data subject and on the progress of the search, if the relative satisfactorily demonstrates his or her identity and close relationship to the data subject.

Special categories of personal data (Article 9 of the General Data Protection Regulation) may be transferred to close relatives only if they prove their identity and their capacity as a relative and if the transfer is necessary to safeguard their rights or the rights of the data subject. The social insurance agencies and authorities are obliged to assist the public-sector controllers and relief organisations if this is necessary to verify the information provided by the inquiring person.

(5) Close relatives pursuant to this provision means parents, children, spouses, registered partners and companions in life of the data subjects. Other relatives may receive the aforementioned information under the same conditions as close relatives if they satisfactorily demonstrate a special close relationship to the person actually or presumably directly affected by a disaster.

(6) The personal data processed for the purposes of managing a disaster shall be deleted immediately if they are no longer required to fulfil the specific purpose.

# Reprimand by the Data Protection Authority

$\S 11$ . The Data Protection Authority shall apply the catalogue of Article 83 paras. 2 to 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation in a manner so as to observe proportionality. In the case of first-time infringements, in particular, the Data Protection Authority shall use its corrective powers in accordance with Article 58 of the General Data Protection Regulation, in particular by issuing reprimands.

§ 12. (1) For the purposes of this Part, recording images means observing occurrences in public or non-public space for private purposes, using technical devices for the processing of images. Recording images also includes acoustic information processed together with the images. This Part shall apply to such recording of images unless other laws provide for more specific provisions.

(2) Considering the requirements pursuant to § 13, recording images is permitted if  
1. it is necessary in the vital interest of a person,  
2. the data subject has consented to the processing of the data subject's personal data,  
3. it is ordered or permitted by special statutory provisions, or  
4. there are overriding legitimate interests of the controller or a third party in a particular case, and proportionality is given.  
(3) Recording images pursuant to para. 2 subpara. 4 is permitted, in particular, if  
1. it serves the precautionary protection of persons and items on private land exclusively used by the controller and does not reach beyond the boundaries of the piece of land, except when it includes public traffic areas, which may be unavoidable to fulfil the purpose of the image recording.  
2. it is required for the precautionary protection of persons or items in publicly accessible places that are subject to the controller's right to undisturbed possession because that right has already been infringed or because the place, by its nature, has a special risk potential, or  
3. it serves a private documentary interest and does not aim to record uninvolved persons to identify them or to record, in a targeted manner, items that are appropriate for indirectly identifying such persons.

(4) It is not permitted to:

1. record images in a data subject's most private sphere without the express consent of the data subject,  
2. record images to monitor employees,  
3. align with other personal data, in an automated manner without express consent and for creating personal profiles, personal data obtained from image recordings, or  
4. analyse personal data obtained from image recordings on the basis of special categories of personal data (Article 9 of the General Data Protection Regulation) as selection criteria.

(5) Data collected by means of permitted image recording may be transferred to the extent required, if one of the requirements of para. 2 subparas. 1 to 4 is met. Para. 4 shall apply accordingly.

# Special data security measures and warning sign

$\S 13$ . (1) The controller shall take appropriate measures corresponding to the risk posed by an interference and ensure that unauthorised persons cannot access or subsequently change the image recording.

(2) Except in the case of real-time surveillance, the controller shall keep logs of every processing operation.  
(3) The controller shall erase personal data recorded if they are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected and if there is no other statutory obligation to maintain the data. Maintaining data for more than 72 hours must be proportionate; separate logs must kept of these data, and reasons must be stated.  
(4) Paras. 1 to 3 shall not be applied to image recordings pursuant to § 12 para. 3 subpara. 3.  
(5) The controller of an image recording must appropriately mark the recording. The warning sign shall clearly specify the controller, unless the controller is already known to the data subjects based on the circumstances of the case.

(6) The obligation to warning sign the data shall not apply in the cases referred to in  $\S 12$  para. 3 subpara. 3 and, in particular cases, to processing operations that must be strictly limited in terms of time and whose purpose can exclusively be achieved by means of covert investigation, provided that the controller ensures there are sufficient safeguards for the data subjects' interests, in particular by subsequent notification of the data subject.  
(7) If, in violation of para. 5, sufficient information is not provided, every data subject potentially affected by a processing operation can request information on the identity of the controller from the owner of, or person authorised to use, the piece of land or building or other property from which the processing operation evidently originates. Failure to provide such information without giving reasons shall be deemed a refusal to provide access pursuant to Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation.

# Powers

$\S 22$ . (1) The Data Protection Authority can request from the controller or the processor of the examined processing all necessary clarifications and inspect data processing activities and relevant documents. The controller or processor shall render the necessary assistance. Supervisory activities are to be exercised in a way that least interferes with the rights of the controller or processor and third parties.

(2) For purposes of the inspection, the Data Protection Authority shall have the right, after having informed the owner of the premises and the controller or processor, to enter rooms where data processing operations are carried out, put data processing equipment into operation, carry out the processing operations to be examined and make copies of the storage media to the extent strictly necessary to exercise its supervisory powers.  
(3) Information acquired by the Data Protection Authority or persons authorised by it during any examination shall be used only for supervisory purposes in the context of the execution of data protection regulations. Incidentally, the obligation of confidentiality also exists before courts and administrative authorities, in particular fiscal authorities, with the reservation that, if the inspection leads to the suspicion that a crime pursuant to § 63 of this federal law or pursuant to § 118a, § 119, § 119a, § 126a to § 126c, § 148a or § 278a of the Criminal Code, Federal Law Gazette No 60/1974, or any crime punishable with more than five years of imprisonment has been committed, this shall be reported to the police, and requests

pursuant to § 76 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Federal Law Gazette No 631/1975, regarding such crimes and offences shall also be complied with.

(4) In case a data processing operation causes serious immediate danger to the interests of confidentiality of the data subject which deserve protection (imminent danger), the Data Protection Authority may prohibit the continuation of the data processing operation by an administrative decision pursuant to  $\S 57$  para. 1 of the General Administrative Procedure Act 1991, Federal Law Gazette No 51/1991. The continuation may also be prohibited only partially if this seems technically possible, meaningful with regard to the purpose of the data processing operation and sufficient to eliminate the danger. At the request of a data subject, the Data Protection Authority can also order, by an administrative decision pursuant to  $\S 57$  para. 1 of the General Administrative Procedure Act, the restriction of processing pursuant to Article 18 of the General Data Protection Regulation if the controller does not comply with an obligation to that effect within the period specified. If prohibition is not complied with immediately, the Data Protection Authority shall proceed pursuant to Article 83 para. 5 of the General Data Protection Regulation.  
(5) As part of its responsibilities, the Data Protection Authority is responsible for imposing administrative fines on natural and legal persons.  
(6) If, with regard to a claim based on § 29 by a data subject represented by a body, organisation or association as referred to in Article 80 para. 1 of the General Data Protection Regulation, there are doubts whether the relevant criteria have been met, the Data Protection Authority shall, at the request of the court where the claim is filed, make appropriate findings in an administrative decision.

# Part 3

# Remedies, liability and penalties

# Complaints with the Data Protection Authority

$\S 24$ . (1) Every data subject has the right to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Authority if the data subject is of the opinion that the processing of the personal data concerning the data subject infringes the General Data Protection Regulation or  $\S 1$  or Chapter 1 Article 2. This shall not apply insofar as the data subject has the right to lodge a complaint with the Parliamentary Data Protection Committee pursuant to  $\S 35\mathrm{f}$  para. 1.  
(2) The complaint must contain:  
1. the description of the right considered to have been infringed,  
2. to the extent reasonable, the description of the legal entity or the executive body or officer that is deemed to be responsible for the alleged infringement (respondent to the complaint),  
3. the facts from which the infringement is derived,  
4. the reasons for which the unlawfulness is alleged,  
5. the request to find that the alleged infringement has been committed, and  
6. the details which are necessary in order to decide whether the complaint has been lodged in due time.  
(3) A complaint must be accompanied by the request on which it is based and the answer of the respondent to the complaint, if any. In the case of a complaint, the Data Protection Authority shall provide further assistance on request of the data subject.  
(4) The right to have a complaint dealt with expires if the intervening party does not lodge the complaint within a year after having gained knowledge of the incident that gave rise to the complaint, but no later than within three years after the incident allegedly occurred. Late complaints shall be rejected.

(5) To the extent the complaint is shown to be justified, it is to be granted. If an infringement can be attributed to a private-sector controller, the controller shall be instructed to comply with the complainant's requests for information, rectification, erasure, restriction or data communication to the extent required to eliminate the infringement that has been found to exist. To the extent that the complaint is not found to be justified, it shall be rejected.

(6) A respondent to the complaint can subsequently eliminate the alleged infringement until the end of the proceedings before the Data Protection Authority by complying with the complainant's requests. If the Data Protection Authority deems the complaint to be settled thereby, it shall hear the complainant on this. Simultaneously, the complainant is to be informed that the Data Protection Authority will informally end the proceedings unless the complainant states reasons, within a reasonable period, why the complainant still considers the originally alleged infringement or at least parts of it as not having been eliminated. If such a statement by the complainant modifies the merits of the case (§ 13 para. 8 of the General Administrative Procedure Act), the original complaint is to be deemed withdrawn and simultaneously a new complaint to be deemed lodged. In this case the original complaint procedure is also to be ended informally and the complainant is to be informed thereof. Late statements are to be ignored.

(7) The data subject shall be informed by the Data Protection Authority of the progress and the outcome of the investigation within three months of filing the complaint.

(8) Each data subject can apply to the Federal Administrative Court if the Data Protection Authority does not handle a complaint or does not inform the data subject within three months of the progress or outcome of the complaint lodged.

(9) To the extent required, the Data Protection Authority can engage official experts to assist in the proceedings.

(10) The term allowed for the decision pursuant to § 73 of the General Administrative Procedure Act shall not include:

1. the time during which proceedings are suspended until a final decision on a preliminary issue has been made;  
2. the duration of proceedings pursuant to Articles 56, 60 and 63 of the General Data Protection Regulation.

# Accompanying measures in the complaint procedure

$\S 25$ . (1) If, in the context of a complaint, the complainant satisfactorily demonstrates a serious infringement of his or her interests in confidentiality which deserve protection due to the processing of the complainant's personal data, the Data Protection Authority may proceed according to  $\S 22$  para. 4.

(2) If the correctness of personal data is disputed in proceedings, the respondent to the complaint shall submit, by the end of the proceedings, a note stating that the correctness is disputed. If required, the Data Protection Authority shall order, by an administrative decision pursuant to  $\S 57$  para. 1 of the General Administrative Procedure Act, such note to be submitted at the request of the complainant.  
(3) If a controller invokes a restriction pursuant to Article 23 of the General Data Protection Regulation in relation to the Data Protection Authority, the Data Protection Authority shall examine the lawfulness of the application of the restrictions. If the Data Protection Authority comes to the conclusion that it was not justified in keeping the processed personal data secret from the data subject, the disclosure of the data shall be ordered by an administrative decision. If the administrative decision by the Data Protection Authority is not complied with within eight weeks, the Data Protection Authority shall disclose the personal data to the data subject and shall communicate to the data subject the desired information or inform the data subject of the personal data that have already been rectified or erased.  
(4) Administrative decisions that permit the transfer of data abroad shall be revoked once the legal or factual prerequisites for the issue of the permit no longer apply.

# Public-sector and private-sector controllers

§ 26. (1) Without prejudice to § 5 para. 3, public-sector controllers are all controllers  
1. that are established in legal structures of public law, in particular also as an executive officer of a territorial authority, or  
2. as far as they execute laws despite having been incorporated according to private law.  
(2) Public-sector controllers have the status of a party in proceedings before the Data Protection Authority.

(3) Public-sector controllers can lodge complaints with the Federal Administrative Court and final complaints with the Supreme Administrative Court.  
(4) Controllers which are not within the scope of para. 1 are considered to be private-sector controllers according to this federal law.

# Complaints with the Federal Administrative Court

$\S 27$ . (1) The Federal Administrative Court shall decide through a panel of judges on complaints against administrative decisions on the ground of a breach of the duty to provide information pursuant to  $\S 24$  para. 7 and the duty to reach a decision of the Data Protection Authority.  
(2) The panel of judges shall consist of a chair and one expert lay judge each from among employers and from among employees. The expert lay judges shall be appointed on the basis of a proposal by the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber and the Federal Chamber of Labour. Appropriate arrangements shall be made so that a sufficient number of expert lay judges is available in due time.  
(3) The expert lay judges must have at least five years of relevant professional experience and special knowledge of data protection law.  
(4) The chair shall provide all documents relevant to the decision to the expert lay judges without delay, or, if this is impractical or strictly necessary to safeguard the confidentiality of the documents, make them available in some other way.  
(5) Where proceedings are brought against an administrative decision of the Data Protection Authority which was preceded by an opinion or a decision of the European Data Protection Board in the consistency mechanism, the Data Protection Authority shall forward that opinion or decision to the Federal Administrative Court.

# Representation of data subjects

$\S 28$ . The data subject shall have the right to mandate a not-for-profit body, organisation or association which has been properly constituted, has statutory objectives which are in the public interest, and is active in the field of the protection of data subjects' rights and freedoms with regard to the protection of their personal data to lodge the complaint on his or her behalf and to exercise the rights referred to in  $\S 24$  to  $\S 27$  on his or her behalf.

# Right to compensation and liability

$\S 29$ . (1) Pursuant to Article 82 of the General Data Protection Regulation, any person who has suffered material or non-material damage as a result of an infringement of the General Data Protection Regulation or  $\S 1$  or Chapter 1 Article 2 shall have the right to receive compensation from the controller or processor for the damage suffered. In detail, the general provisions of civil law shall apply to this right to compensation.

(2) The regional court entrusted with exercising jurisdiction in civil matters in whose judicial district the plaintiff (applicant) has his usual place of residence or registered office shall have first-instance jurisdiction over actions for compensation. Actions (requests) may, however, also be brought before the regional court in whose judicial district the defendant has his usual place of residence or registered office or a branch office.

# General conditions for imposing administrative fines

$\S 30$ . (1) The Data Protection Authority can impose administrative fines on a legal person if infringements of provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation and of  $\S 1$  or Chapter 1 Article 2 were committed by persons who acted either individually or as part of an executive body of the legal person and have a leading position within the legal person on the basis of:

1. a power of representation of the legal person,  
2. the authority to take decisions on behalf of the legal person, or  
3. the authority to exercise control within the legal person.

(2) Legal persons may also be held responsible for infringements of provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation and of  $\S 1$  or Chapter 1 Article 2 if such infringements by a person acting for the legal person were made possible by a lack of supervision or control by one of the persons referred to in para. 1 unless the act constitutes a criminal offence within the jurisdiction of the courts.  
(3) The Data Protection Authority shall refrain from imposing a fine on a responsible party pursuant to  $\S 9$  of the Administrative Penal Act 1991, Federal Law Gazette 52/1991, if an administrative penalty has already been imposed on the legal person for the same infringement.

(4) Administrative fines imposed pursuant to  $\S 22$  para. 5 shall be received by the Federal Government and shall be collected pursuant to the provisions on the collection of judicial fines. Final administrative decisions by the Data Protection Authority are writs of enforcement. Approval and implementation of enforcement is to be requested on the basis of the writ of enforcement by the Data Protection Authority from the district court in whose judicial district the obligated party has his or her general place of jurisdiction ( $\S 66$  and  $\S 75$  of the Court Jurisdiction Act, Imperial Law Gazette No 111/1895) or from the enforcing court referred to in  $\S 18$  and  $\S 19$  of the Enforcement Code.  
(5) Administrative fines cannot be imposed on authorities and public entities, such as, in particular, entities established in a form provided by public law as well as private law, which act on the basis of a statutory mandate, and on corporations under public law.

# Data Protection Authority

$\S 31$ . (1) The Data Protection Authority is established as a national supervisory authority for the scope referred to in  $\S 36$  para. 1. The Data Protection Authority shall not be competent to supervise processing operations of courts acting in their judicial capacity.  
(2) In respect of independence, general provisions and the establishment of the supervisory authority, Articles 52, 53 and 54 of the General Data Protection Regulation and § 18 para. 2, § 19 and § 20 shall apply accordingly.

§ 37. (1) Personal data shall be:

1. processed lawfully and fairly;  
2. collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and shall not be processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes;  
3. adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are processed;  
4. accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay;  
5. kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed;  
6. processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.

(2) § 38 shall apply to processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in the scope of § 36 para. 1.  
(3) The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paras. 1 and 2.  
(4) As far as possible and reasonable, a clear distinction between personal data of different categories of data subjects, such as the following, shall be made:

1. persons who, on the basis of certain facts, are specifically suspected of having committed a criminal offence,  
2. persons with regard to whom, on the basis of certain facts, there are serious grounds for believing that they are about to commit a criminal offence,  
3. persons convicted of a criminal offence;  
4. victims of a criminal offence or persons with regard to whom certain facts give rise to reasons for believing that they are the victims of a criminal offence, and  
5. other persons connected to a criminal offence, such as persons who might be called on to testify, persons who can provide information on criminal offences, or contacts or associates of one of the persons referred to in subparas. 1 to 3.

(5) Personal data based on facts are to be distinguished, as far as possible, from personal data based on personal assessments. Personal data based on personal assessments must be marked accordingly, and reasons can be added to facilitate the understanding of an assessment.  
(6) Incorrect or incomplete personal data, personal data that are no longer current or are to be erased must neither be transferred nor made available for automated retrieval from filing systems. For that purpose, the authority shall check the data quality accordingly as far as possible before a transmission. Personal data kept ready for automated retrieval must be kept complete and up to date at all times.  
(7) As far as possible, the information required for the recipient to assess the up-to-dateness, correctness, completeness and reliability of the personal data shall be added in any transmission of personal data.  
(8) If it is found ex officio or following notification by a data subject that personal data that do not comply with the requirements of para. 6 have been transmitted, the transmitting administrative office and authority, or the administrative office and authority keeping the filing system shall notify the receiving office or authority thereof without delay. The receiving office or authority shall immediately erase data which have been unlawfully transmitted, rectify incorrect data, complete incomplete data or restrict processing without delay.

(9) If the receiving administrative office or authority has reason to believe that the personal data transmitted are incorrect or not up to date or would have to be erased, or that their processing would have to be restricted, the receiving administrative office or authority shall notify the transmitting administrative office or authority thereof without delay. The latter shall take the required measures without delay.

# Lawfulness of processing

$\S 38$ . Unless it is required to protect the vital interests of a person, processing is lawful only to the extent it is provided for by laws or by directly applicable legal provisions that have the status of laws in Austria and is required and proportionate to fulfil a task performed by the competent authority for the purposes referred to in  $\S 36$  para. 1.

# Processing of special categories of personal data

§ 39. Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation for the purposes referred to in § 36 para. 1 shall be allowed only where strictly necessary and if effective measures to protect the rights and freedoms of the data subjects are taken and

1. where authorised pursuant to  $\S 38$  , or  
2. where such processing relates to data which are manifestly made public by the data subject.

# Processing for other purposes, and transfer

$\S 40$ . (1) Processing of personal data pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter by the same or another controller for a purpose other than the one for which the data were collected shall be allowed only if this other purpose is covered by the scope of  $\S 36$  para. 1 and the requirements of  $\S 38$  and  $\S 39$  are met.

(2) Transferring personal data processed pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter for a purpose not referred to in  $\S 36$  para. 1 shall be allowed only if this is

expressly provided for by laws or by directly applicable legal provisions that have the status of laws in Austria, and the recipient is authorised to process these personal data for such other purpose.

(3) If the processing of personal data is subject to special conditions, the transmitting competent authority shall inform the recipient of the personal data that such conditions apply and must be complied with. Transfers to recipients in other Member States or to bodies, offices and agencies established pursuant to Title V Chapters 4 and 5 of the TFEU must not be subject to conditions that do not apply to domestic data transmissions as well.

# Automated individual decision-making

$\S 41$ . (1) Decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which have negative legal consequences for the data subject or can significantly affect the data subject, shall be allowed only to the extent they are expressly provided for by laws or by directly applicable legal provisions that have the status of laws in Austria.  
(2) Decisions referred to in para. 1 shall not be based on special categories of personal data referred to in § 39 unless effective measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests are in place.  
(3) Decisions pursuant to para. 1 that have the consequence that natural persons are discriminated against on the basis of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation shall be prohibited.

# Part 2 Rights of the data subject

# Principles

$\S 42$ . (1) The controller shall provide any information and make any communication with regard to  $\S 43$  to  $\S 45$  relating to processing to the data subject

in as concise, intelligible and easily accessible a form as possible, using clear and plain language. The information shall be transmitted in an appropriate manner, in the case of a request in the same form as the request, if possible.

(2) The controller shall facilitate the exercise of the rights of the data subject pursuant to  $\S 43$  to 45.

(3) The controller shall inform the data subject in writing about the follow-up to his or her request without undue delay.

(4) The controller shall provide the data subject with information on measures taken because of a request pursuant to § 44 to § 45 without delay, but in any event within one month after receipt of the request. That period may be extended by two further months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests. The controller shall inform the data subject of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay. Where the data subject makes the request by electronic means, the information shall be provided by electronic means where possible, unless otherwise requested by the data subject.

(5) If the controller does not take action on the request of the data subject, the controller shall inform the data subject without delay and at the latest within one month of receipt of the request of the reasons for not taking action and on the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and seeking a judicial remedy.

(6) Information provided under § 43 and any communication and any action taken under § 44 and 45 shall be provided free of charge. Where requests from a data subject are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, the controller may either:

1. charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested, or  
2. refuse to act on the request.

The controller shall bear the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded or excessive character of the request.

(7) The controller may request the provision of additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the person who submitted a request pursuant to § 44 or § 45.  
(8) In the cases referred to in § 43 para. 4, § 44 para. 3 and § 45 para. 4, the data subject is entitled to request verification of the lawfulness of the relevant restriction of the data subject's rights by the Data Protection Authority. The controller shall inform the data subject of this right.  
(9) Where the right referred to in para. 8 is exercised, the Data Protection Authority shall inform the data subject at least that all necessary verifications or a review by the Data Protection Authority have taken place. In addition, the Data Protection Authority shall inform the data subject of the data subject's right to lodge complaints with the Federal Administrative Court.

# Information of the data subject

$\S 43$ . (1) The controller shall make available to the data subject at least the following information:

1. the identity and the contact details of the controller;  
2. the contact details of the data protection officer, where applicable;  
3. the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended;  
4. the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority and the contact details of the supervisory authority;  
5. the existence of the right to request from the controller access to and rectification or erasure of personal data and restriction of processing of the personal data concerning the data subject.

(2) In addition to the information referred to in para. 1, the controller shall give to the data subject, in specific cases, the following further information to enable the exercise of his or her rights:

1. the legal basis for the processing;  
2. the period for which the personal data will be stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;  
3. where applicable, the categories of recipients of the personal data, including in third countries or international organisations;

4. where necessary, further information, in particular where the personal data are collected without the knowledge of the data subject.

(3) Where personal data are collected from the data subject, the data subject must be in possession of the information pursuant to the requirements of paras. 1 and 2 at the time of the collection of the personal data. In all other cases, Article 14 para. 3 of the General Data Protection Regulation shall apply. The information according to paras. 1 and 2 may be omitted where data have not been collected by asking the data subject, but through transmission from another application purpose of the same controller or from a data application of another controller, and where the processing is provided for by law.

(4) The provision of the information to the data subject pursuant to para. 2 can be delayed, restricted or omitted to the extent this is strictly necessary and proportionate in a particular case to

1. avoid prejudicing the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, in particular by obstructing inquiries, investigations or proceedings of authorities or courts,

2. protect public security,  
3. protect national security,  
4. protect the constitutional institutions of the Republic of Austria,  
5. enable the protection of military facilities by the armed forces, or  
6. protect the rights and freedoms of others.

# Right of access by the data subject

§ 44. (1) Every data subject has the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and the following information:

1. the purposes of and legal basis for the processing,  
2. the categories of personal data concerned,  
3. the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organisations,

4. if possible, the period for which the personal data are planned to be stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period,  
5. the existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing of personal data concerning the data subject,  
6. the right to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Authority and the contact details of the Data Protection Authority, and  
7. communication of the personal data undergoing processing and of any available information as to their origin.  
(2) Restrictions of the right of access are permitted only on the conditions referred to in § 43 para. 4.  
(3) In case access is not granted pursuant to para. 2, the controller shall inform the data subject, without undue delay, in writing of any refusal or restriction of access and of the reasons for the refusal or the restriction. Such information may be omitted where the provision thereof would undermine a purpose under  $\S 43$  para. 4. The controller shall inform the data subject of the possibility to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Authority.  
(4) The controller shall document the reasons for the decision not to grant access pursuant to para. 2. That information shall be made available to the Data Protection Authority.  
(5) To the extent that a data processing operation is, by law, open to inspection by a data subject with regard to data processed on the data subject, the data subject shall have a right of access in accordance with the provisions granting the right of inspection. The detailed provisions of the law granting the right of inspection shall apply to the procedure of inspection (and its refusal). Parts of information according to para. 1 that are not covered by the right of inspection may, however, be asserted according to this federal law.

# Right to rectification or erasure of personal data and to the restriction of processing

$\S 45$ . (1) Every data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning him or her and the completion of incomplete personal data. Where necessary, the personal data can be rectified or completed by means of a supplementary statement if later changes are incompatible with the documentation purpose. It shall be the obligation of the controller to prove that the data are correct unless the personal data have been collected exclusively based on statements made by the data subject.

(2) The controller shall erase the personal data on the controller's own initiative or at the request of the data subject if  
1. the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed,  
2. the personal data have been unlawfully processed,  
3. erasure is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.  
(3) Instead of erasure, the controller shall restrict processing where:  
1. the accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject and their accuracy or inaccuracy cannot be ascertained, or  
2. the personal data must be maintained for the purposes of evidence to perform a task delegated to the controller by law.  
In the case of a restriction pursuant to subpara. 1, the controller shall inform the data subject before the restriction is lifted.  
(4) The controller shall inform the data subject in writing of any refusal of rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing and of the reasons for the refusal. The controller shall inform the data subject of the possibility to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Authority.  
(5) The controller shall communicate the rectification of inaccurate personal data to the competent authority from which the inaccurate personal data originate.

(6) Where personal data has been rectified or erased or processing has been restricted pursuant to paras. 1 to 3, the controller shall notify all recipients of the personal data concerned. The recipients shall rectify or erase the personal data or restrict processing of the personal data under their responsibility without undue delay.

# Controller and processor

# Obligations of the controller

$\S 46$ . The controller shall comply with the obligations referred to in Article 24 paras. 1 and 2 and Article 25 paras. 1 and 2 of the General Data Protection Regulation with regard to the compliance of processing with the provisions of this Chapter.

# Joint controllers

$\S 47$ . Two or more controllers who jointly determine the purposes and means of processing shall be joint controllers. They shall, in a transparent manner, determine their respective responsibilities under this federal law, in particular as regards the exercising of the rights of the data subject and their respective duties to provide the information referred to in  $\S 43$ , by means of an arrangement between them if, and insofar as, the respective responsibilities of the controllers are not determined by law. The arrangement shall designate a contact point for data subjects.

# Processor and the supervision of processing

$\S 48$ . (1) Where processing is carried out on behalf of a controller, the controller shall only use processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that processing will meet the requirements of this federal law and ensure the protection of the rights of the data subject.

(2) The processor shall not engage another processor without prior specific written authorisation of the controller.

(3) Processing by a processor shall be governed by a contract or other legal act under Union law or on the grounds of an explicit legal authorisation that is binding on the processor with regard to the controller and that sets out the subject matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the controller. This contract or other legal act shall stipulate, in particular, that the processor:

1. processes the personal data only on documented instructions from the controller, including with regard to transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation, unless required to do so by Union law or by laws to which the processor is subject; in such a case, the processor shall inform the controller of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest;  
2. ensures that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality;  
3. takes all measures necessary pursuant to  $\S 54$  
4. respects the conditions referred to in paras. 2 and 4 for engaging another processor;  
5. taking into account the nature of the processing, assists the controller by appropriate technical and organisational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment of the controller's obligation to respond to requests for exercising the data subject's rights laid down in this Chapter;  
6. assists the controller in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to § 52 to § 56, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor;  
7. at the choice of the controller, deletes or returns all the personal data to the controller after the end of the provision of services relating to processing, and deletes existing copies unless Union law or laws require(s) storage of the personal data;

8. makes available to the controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in paras. 1 to 6 and allows for and contributes to audits, including inspections, conducted by the controller or another auditor mandated by the controller.

With regard to subpara. 8, the processor shall immediately inform the controller if, in its opinion, an instruction infringes this Chapter or other data protection provisions of Union law or statutory data protection provisions.

(4) Where a processor engages another processor for carrying out specific processing activities on behalf of the controller, the same data protection obligations as set out in the contract or other legal act between the controller and the processor as referred to in para. 3 shall be imposed on that other processor by way of a contract or other legal act under Union law or in accordance with laws, in particular providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that the processing will meet the requirements of this Chapter. Where that other processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations, the initial processor shall remain fully liable to the controller for the performance of that other processor's obligations.

(5) The contract or the other legal act referred to in paras. 3 and 4 shall be in writing, including in electronic form.  
(6) The processor and any person acting under the authority of the controller or of the processor, who has access to personal data, shall not process those data except on instructions from the controller, unless required to do so by Union law or in accordance with laws.  
(7) If a processor determines, in infringement of this Chapter, the purposes and means of processing, that processor shall be considered to be a controller in respect of that processing.

# Records of processing activities

$\S 49$ . (1) Each controller shall maintain a record of processing activities, applying Article 30 paras. 1 to 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation accordingly; the references in Article 30 para. 1 (g) and para. 2 (d) of the General

Data Protection Regulation refer to § 54, and the reference to the representative of the controller or the processor shall not apply.

(2) The record referred to in para. 1 shall also contain information on  
1. the use of profiling, if profiling is used, and  
2. the legal basis for the processing operation, including transfers, for which the personal data are intended.

1. name and contact details of the processor or processors, each controller on whose behalf the processor is acting, as well as any data protection officer,  
2. the categories of processing activities performed on behalf of each controller,  
3. where applicable, transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation, if ordered accordingly by the controller, including the identification of the third country or the international organisation,  
4. if possible, a general description of the technical and organisational measures pursuant to  $\S 54$  para. 1.

# Logging

§ 50. (1) Every processing operation shall be logged in an appropriate manner so that the legitimacy of processing can be traced and verified.

(2) In automated processing systems, all processing operations shall be logged in an automated manner. These log data shall at least reveal the purpose, the processed data, the date and time of processing, the identification of the person who processed the personal data, and the identity of any recipient of such personal data.  
(3) In non-automated processing systems, at least consultations and disclosures, including transmissions, changes and erasures, shall be logged. Para. 2 sentence 2 shall apply to these log data.

(4) The logs shall exclusively be used to verify the lawfulness of the data processing, including self-monitoring and ensuring the integrity and security of the personal data, and in criminal proceedings in court.  
(5) The controller and the processor shall provide the logs to the Data Protection Authority at its request.

§ 58. (1) Any transfer by competent authorities of personal data which are undergoing processing or are intended for processing after transfer to a third country or to an international organisation shall take place only if the conditions laid down in this Chapter are complied with and

1. the transfer is necessary for the purposes set out in  $\S 36$  para. 1,

2. the personal data are transferred to a controller in a third country or international organisation that is an authority competent for the purposes referred to in  $\S 36$  para. 1,

3. where personal data are transmitted or made available from another EU Member State, that Member State has given its prior authorisation to the transfer,

4. the European Commission has adopted an adequacy decision pursuant to § 59 paras. 1 and 2 or, in the absence of such a decision, appropriate safeguards as referred to in § 59 paras. 3 to 5 have been provided or exist, or, in the absence of an adequacy decision pursuant to § 59 paras. 1 and 2 and of appropriate safeguards in accordance with § 59 paras. 3 to 5, derogations for specific situations apply pursuant to § 59 paras. 6 and 7; and

5. it is ensured that an onward transfer to another third country or international organisation is permitted only subject to prior authorisation by the competent authority that carried out the original transfer and after taking into due account all relevant factors, including the seriousness of the criminal offence, the purpose for which the personal data was originally transferred and the level of personal data protection in the third country or an international organisation to which personal data are onward transferred.

(2) Transfers without prior authorisation pursuant to para. 1 subpara. 3 shall be permitted only if the transfer is necessary for the prevention of an immediate and

serious threat to public security of a Member State or a third country or to essential interests of a Member State and the prior authorisation cannot be obtained in good time. The authority responsible for giving prior authorisation shall be informed without delay.

(3) If a competent authority of another EU Member State requests authorisation to transfer to a third country or an international organisation pursuant to para. 1 subpara. 3 personal data that have originally been transferred from Austria, the authority that originally transferred the personal data shall be the authority competent for giving the authorisation, unless otherwise provided for by law.

# Data transfers to third countries or international organisations

$\S 59$ . (1) The transfer of personal data to a third country or an international organisation shall be permitted where the European Commission has decided pursuant to Article 36 para. 3 of Directive (EU) 2016/680 by way of an implementing act that the third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors within that third country, or the international organisation in question ensures an adequate level of protection. Such a transfer shall not require any specific authorisation. The authorisation obligation pursuant to  $\S 58$  para. 1 subpara. 3 shall remain unaffected thereby.

(2) A decision by the European Commission taken pursuant to Article 36 para. 5 of Directive (EU) 2016/680 to revoke, amend or suspend a decision pursuant to Article 36 para. 3 of Directive (EU) 2016/680 shall be without prejudice to transfers of personal data to the third country, the territory or one or more specified sectors within that third country, or the international organisation in question pursuant to paras. 3 to 8.

(3) In the absence of a decision pursuant to para. 1, a transfer of personal data to a third country or an international organisation may take place where

1. appropriate safeguards with regard to the protection of personal data are provided for in a legally binding instrument; or  
2. the controller, following an assessment of the circumstances relevant for the transfer of personal data, concludes that appropriate safeguards exist with regard to the protection of personal data.

(5) Transfers pursuant to para. 3 subpara. 2 shall be documented, and the documentation shall be made available to the Data Protection Authority on request, including the date and time of the transfer, information about the receiving competent authority, the justification for the transfer and the personal data transferred.  
(6) In the absence of an adequacy decision pursuant to paras. 1 to 2 or of appropriate safeguards pursuant to paras. 3 to 5, a transfer of personal data to a third country or an international organisation may take place in accordance with para. 5 only on the condition that the transfer is necessary:  
1. to protect the vital interests of a person,  
2. to safeguard legitimate interests of the data subject, where the law so provides,  
3. for the prevention of an immediate and serious threat to the public security of an EU Member State or a third country,  
4. in individual cases for the purposes set out in  $\S 36$  para. 1, or  
5. in an individual case for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims relating to the purposes set out in  $\S 36$  para. 1.  
(7) In the cases referred to in para. 6 subparas. 4 and 5, a transfer is permitted only if no fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject overriding the public interests in the transfer are an obstacle to the transfer.

# Chapter 4 Special penal provisions Administrative penalties
