PROCLAMATION TO PROVIDE FOR

# PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION

WHEREAS, the lack of laws detailing individuals' rights concerning their personal data and the absence of a dedicated regulatory authority to oversee personal data protection has resulted in the absence of a robust personal data protection system in the country, and adopting a personal data protection proclamation is essential to prevent violations of personal data during its collection and processing;

WHEREAS, with the advancement of digital technology, the type and number of services delivered directly through the information network have expanded, and it is necessary to collect personal data to ensure these services are tailored to the needs of the users and streamline their delivery; and the role of processing personal data collected during digital service delivery is increasingly significant for social and economic development;

WHEREAS, it is critical to provide effective solutions to personal data breaches, reduce risks associated with data processing operations, encourage innovation, build trust in the digital economy, and foster a culture of responsible data processing;

WHEREAS, it is crucial to establish a robust personal data protection framework in Ethiopia aligned with international standards and to capitalize on beneficial opportunities presented by cross-border transfer of personal data both into and out of the country;

NOW, THEREFORE, in accordance with Article 55(1) of the Constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, it is hereby proclaimed as follows:
