I hope you find this translation helpful. Let me know if you have further questions or need additional clarification.

Article 10

The electronic signature is valid if it fulfills the following conditions:

It is unique to the person who used it.
It identifies the owner of the signature.
The information for creating the signature and the method of its use are entirely under the control of the owner of the signature.
No change has occurred in the electronic transaction since the electronic signature was applied; and after signing, it is void if any of the conditions stated in this article are not met.
Article 11

The person who creates an electronic signature is obliged to the following:

Not to use the signature tool in an unlawful manner.
To exercise care to prevent unauthorized use of his signature-creating information.
To immediately use the means available to him by the certification service provider and to make efforts to notify any person who is expected to rely on or provide services based on his electronic signature if the signer knows that the signature creation tool has been compromised or if the circumstances known to the signer suggest a significant likelihood that the signature tool has been compromised.
To exercise care when using a certificate to enhance the electronic signature, to ensure the accuracy and completeness of all essential data provided by the signer that is closely related to the certificate or that should be included in the certificate.
To notify the certification service provider of any breaches or unauthorized use of the signature elements and provide necessary information.
The executive regulation of this law specifies the procedures, deadlines, and form of the notification referred to.

Article 12

Without prejudice to any special provisions, the signer bears the legal consequences resulting from his non-compliance with the provisions of the previous article.

Article 13

After the electronic signature is effective, it has the same legal effect regardless of the geographic location where this signature is created or used, or the geographic location of the place of business of the site creator.

Article 14

Anyone who relies on an electronic signature bears the legal consequences of failing to take the necessary steps to verify that the electronic signature meets the conditions set forth in Article 10 of this law.

The executive regulation defines the conditions for verifying the validity of the authentication certificate and its source or its suspension or cancellation or any known restriction, in case the electronic signature is enhanced by the authentication certificate.

Article 15

If the law requires the writing of any paper, document, record, statement, information, or arranges results for lack of writing, then the occurrence of any of these in electronic form fulfills the writing requirement if it meets the preservation conditions provided for in Article 16.

Article 16

When any law requires the preservation of any paper, document, record, statement, or information for any reason, this is achieved by preserving it in electronic form, taking into account the following:

Preserve the paper, document, record, information, or data electronically in the form in which it was originally created, sent, or received, or in a manner that allows proof that it accurately represents the paper, document, record, information, or data that was originally created, sent, or received.
The paper, document, record, information, or data remains preserved in a manner that allows access to, and use of, it and reference to it later.
The paper, document, record, information, or data is stored in a manner that enables identification of the origin and destination of the electronic message and the time it was sent or delivered.
Article 17

If the law requires presenting or retaining a paper, document, record, or electronic message in its original form, or arranges specific consequences for the unavailability of that, it is considered original if email is used for its transmission in a manner that ensures the integrity of the data, or any other method that technically guarantees the integrity of the information contained in it from the time it was originally created in its final form. This also allows for the display of the required information and the fulfillment of any other required conditions.

Article 18

A paper copy of the original electronic document is valid proof for everyone to the extent that it matches the original of that document, provided that the original electronic document and electronic signature exist on an electronic medium, which is any physical means used for the storage and exchange of electronic information and data.

Article 19

Electronic records and messages have the same legal effects recognized for traditional papers, and this effect cannot be ignored merely because they appear wholly or partially in electronic form, taking into account the following:

The method by which the record, contract, or electronic message was created or preserved.
The method by which it was signed.
The method used to maintain the integrity of the information contained in the record, contract, or message.
The method that identified the creator’s age.
Article 20

An electronic message is considered to be issued by the creator if he sent it himself, or if it was sent by someone authorized to act on his behalf due to his job, or if it was sent in accordance with an automated information system programmed by the creator or on his behalf to operate automatically.

Article 21

The recipient may consider the electronic message to have been issued by the creator and may act based on that, unless he is notified by the creator that the message was not issued by him in sufficient time, or if the recipient knew or should have known, if adequate care was taken or an agreed procedure was followed, that the electronic message was not issued by the creator.

Article 22

If the sender stipulates in the electronic message the receipt of an acknowledgment, the message is considered as if it was not sent until the acknowledgment is received.

If the sender has not specified, or it has not been agreed upon, that the acknowledgment should be in a certain form, acknowledgment can be made through any automated communication or any other means or any behavior on the part of the recipient that is sufficient to inform the sender of receipt.

Article 23

An electronic message is considered sent when it enters an electronic information system outside the control of the creator or the person who sent the message on his behalf, unless there is an agreement between them to the contrary.

Article 24

The delivery time of the electronic message is determined as follows:

If the recipient has not designated an information system, the delivery of the electronic message is the time it enters an information system controlled by the recipient.

In the case where the recipient designates an information system for the purpose of receiving, delivery is at the time when the electronic message enters that system. If the message enters an information system controlled by the recipient other than the designated system, the delivery time is when the electronic message is retrieved by the recipient.

Article 25

An electronic message is considered to have been sent from the place where the sender's place of business is located and is considered to have been received at the recipient's place of business, even if the place where the information system is located differs from the place where the message is assumed to have been delivered. If the creator or the recipient has more than one place of business, the place of business most closely related to the relevant transaction is considered. The main place of business is considered if there is no specific transaction. If neither has a place of business, their place of residence is considered.

Article 26

The acknowledgment of receipt itself is not evidence that the content of the received message matches the content of the message sent from the sender.

Chapter Three: Electronic Authentication

Chapter Four: Electronic Transactions
Article 45

When concluding a contract, expression of consent or acceptance, either in whole or in part, is permissible via electronic messages. Using multiple messages does not affect the contract's validity or enforceability as long as it is in accordance with the provisions of this law.

Article 46

Contracting can occur between autonomous electronic means, including one or more pre-programmed electronic information systems designated to carry out such tasks. The contract is valid, enforceable, and produces its legal effects despite the absence of personal or direct intervention of any natural person in the contract formation process.

Furthermore, contracting may occur between an autonomous electronic information system under the control of a natural or legal person and an individual, provided the latter knows or is supposed to know that the system will undertake the contracting process, whether the individual is acting on their own behalf or on behalf of another.

Electronic contracts have the same legal effects as contracts made through traditional methods in terms of proof, validity, enforceability, and other provisions.

Article 47

Unless otherwise agreed upon, the time and place of contract formation are the time and place where the electronic message accepting the offer is received.

In this case, the seller must refund the amount paid and any expenses incurred back to the consumer within ten days from the date of the product's return.

In all cases, the seller is obligated to compensate for the damages he might have caused the consumer, if applicable.

Article 53

In consideration of the provisions of Article 18 of this law and except for cases of apparent or hidden defects, the consumer may not cancel the purchase in the following situations:

When the consumer requests the provision of the service before the expiry of the withdrawal period, and the seller provides it.
If the consumer is provided with products according to personal specifications, or products that cannot be sent back, or are susceptible to damage, deterioration, or expiration.
If the consumer removes the seals from audio recordings, visual recordings, software, and media materials.
Purchase of books, newspapers, and magazines.
Article 54

If the purchase is entirely or partially the result of a loan granted to the consumer by the seller or another party based on a contract made between the seller and someone other than the consumer, then the consumer's withdrawal from the purchase nullifies the loan contract without any compensation.

Article 55

In the case of a sale with a trial period, the seller is liable for any damages that the product may sustain until the end of the trial period, except in cases of misuse by the consumer. This is after nullifying any conditions that exempt from liability.

Article 56

In the event that the product or service is not available, the seller must inform the consumer within a maximum period of 24 hours before the delivery date stipulated in the contract and return the full amount paid to the owner.

The contract is voided if the seller fails to fulfill his obligations, and the consumer recovers the amount paid while retaining the right to compensation in the case of damage, unless such breach or damage results from force majeure.

Article 57

In the event of a dispute, the seller is required to prove that he has fulfilled his obligations stipulated in this chapter. Any agreement to the contrary is null and void.

They must pay the cardholder amounts withdrawn from his account without a legitimate reason, or contrary to what was agreed upon in the contract.

Article 68

The cardholder must use his banking card according to the agreed-upon terms and take all necessary precautions to protect the card and the identification information that enables its use. The cardholder cannot reverse any electronic payment order issued by this card.
