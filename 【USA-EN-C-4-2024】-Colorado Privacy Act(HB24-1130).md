HOUSE BILL 24-1130

BY REPRESENTATIVE(S) Daugherty and Lynch, Amabile, Bacon, Bird, Boesenecker, Brown, deGruy Kennedy, Duran, Hamrick, Herod, Jodeh, Kipp, Lieder, Lindsay, Mabrey, Marshall, Marvin, Parenti, Rutinel, Sirota, Titone, Valdez, Weinberg, Weissman, Young, McCluskie, Clifford, Frizell, Joseph, Martinez, Ricks, Soper, Story; also SENATOR(S) Lundeen and Hansen, Baisley, Bridges, Buckner, Cutter, Gardner, Ginal, Gonzales, Hinrichsen, Michaelson Jenet, Pelton B., Priola, Van Winkle, Will.

CONCERNING PROTECTING THE PRIVACY OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S BIOMETRIC DATA.

Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:

SECTION 1. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly finds that:

(a) Businesses increasingly use biometric identifiers to attempt to verify customer identities, streamline transactions, control access to secure areas, and maximize revenues;  
(b) Biometric identifiers are unlike other unique identifiers that are

used to verify identity or to access finances or other sensitive information because, unlike social security numbers, for example, biometric identifiers cannot be changed; they are unique to an individual, and once an individual's biometric identifiers are compromised, the individual has no recourse, is at heightened risk for identity theft, and may no longer feel safe participating in biometric-facilitated transactions;

(c) The public has grown wary of the use of biometric identifiers due to recent data breaches that have exposed many individuals' biometric identifiers, leaving those individuals vulnerable to harm; and  
(d) Biometric identifiers can be collected without an individual's knowledge, applied instantaneously to identify the individual in circumstances where the individual has an expectation of privacy and anonymity, and used to identify and track the individual's movements, activities, and associations.  
(2) The general assembly further finds that:  
(a) One increasingly prevalent biometric collection and matching technology, facial recognition technology, has been shown to have higher rates of misidentification and misclassification when it is used on faces of color, of women, of children, of the elderly, and of transgender and nonbinary persons; and  
(b) This misidentification and misclassification has led to documented cases of businesses refusing admission or service to individuals because facial recognition systems incorrectly "matched" the individuals to photos of suspected shoplifters or other individuals who had been barred from the premises.  
(3) While increasing protections for individuals' biometric identifiers is of the utmost importance, critical privacy protections must be balanced with the use of biometric data to support public safety as outlined in state and federal statutes. The "Colorado Privacy Act", part 13 of article 1 of title 6, Colorado Revised Statutes, includes a variety of exceptions to the requirements established in this act, including permitted uses of biometric data for public safety needs, and all of the exceptions that apply to the entirety of the "Colorado Privacy Act" apply to the protections established for biometric data and biometric identifiers in this act.

(4) Therefore, the general assembly declares that the public welfare, security, and safety will be served by regulating the collection, use, safeguarding, handling, storage, retention, and destruction of biometric identifiers.

SECTION 2. In Colorado Revised Statutes, add 6-1-1314 as follows:
