A known child's parent or legal guardian may invoke on behalf of the child one (1) or more rights set forth in subsection (b) with respect to the processing of personal data belonging to the known child by submitting to a controller a request specifying the rights the consumer wishes to invoke on behalf of the child. Except as provided in IC 24-15-7-1(c) and IC 24-15-7-2, and subject to any limitations or conditions set forth in subsections (b) and (c), a controller shall comply with an authenticated consumer request to exercise a right set forth in subsection (b).

(b) A consumer has the following rights:

(1) To confirm whether or not a controller is processing the consumer's personal data and, subject to the limitations set forth in subdivision (4), to access such personal data.  
(2) To correct inaccuracies in the consumer's personal data that the consumer previously provided to a controller, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the purposes of the processing of the consumer's personal data. Upon receiving a request from a consumer under this subdivision, a controller shall correct inaccurate information as requested by the consumer, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the purposes of the processing of the consumer's personal data.  
(3) To delete personal data provided by or obtained about the consumer.  
(4) To obtain either:

(A) a copy of; or

(B) a representative summary of;

the consumer's personal data that the consumer previously provided to the controller. Information provided to a consumer under this subdivision must be in a portable and, to the extent technically practicable, readily usable format that allows the consumer to transmit the data or summary to another controller without hindrance, in any case in which the processing is carried out by automated means. The controller has the discretion to send either a copy or a representative summary of the consumer's personal data under this

subdivision, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the purposes of the processing of the consumer's personal data. A controller is not required to provide a copy or a representative summary of a consumer's personal data to the same consumer under this subdivision more than one (1) time in a twelve (12) month period.  
(5) To opt out of the processing of the consumer's personal data for purposes of:

(A) targeted advertising;  
(B) the sale of personal data; or  
(C) profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning the consumer.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this article, a controller shall comply with a request by a consumer to exercise a consumer right set forth in subsection (b) as follows:

(1) A controller shall respond to the consumer without undue delay, but in any case not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt of the consumer's request under this section. The response period prescribed by this subdivision may be extended once by an additional forty-five (45) days when reasonably necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the consumer's requests, as long as the controller informs the consumer of any such extension within the initial forty-five (45) day response period, along with the reason for the extension.  
(2) If a controller declines to take action regarding the consumer's request, the controller shall inform the consumer without undue delay, but in any case not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt of the consumer's request under this section, of the justification for declining to take action, and shall provide instructions for how to appeal the decision under subsection (d).  
(3) Information provided in response to a consumer request shall be provided by a controller free of charge, up to one (1) time annually per consumer. If requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repetitive, the controller may charge the consumer a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying with the request or decline to act on the request. The controller bears the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repetitive nature of the request.  
(4) If a controller is unable to authenticate the request using

commercially reasonable efforts, the controller shall not be required to comply with a request to initiate an action under this section and may request that the consumer provide additional information reasonably necessary to authenticate the consumer and the consumer's request.

(5) A controller that has obtained personal data about a consumer from a source other than the consumer is considered to comply with a request by the consumer under subsection (b)(3) to delete the consumer's personal data if the controller:

(A) retains:

(i) a record of the consumer's request for deletion; and

(ii) the minimum data necessary to ensure that the consumer's personal data remains deleted from the controller's records; and

(B) does not use the data retained under clause (A)(ii) for any other purpose.

(d) A controller shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal, within a reasonable period of time after the consumer's receipt of a decision by the controller under subsection (c)(2), the controller's refusal to take action on a request by the consumer under this section. The appeal process shall be conspicuously available and similar to the process for submitting requests to invoke a right under this section. Not later than sixty (60) days after receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the consumer with an online mechanism, if available, or other method through which the consumer may contact the attorney general to submit a complaint.

Chapter 4. Data Controller Responsibilities; Transparency

Sec. 1. Except as provided in IC 24-15-7-2, a controller has the following responsibilities:

(1) A controller shall limit the collection of personal data to what is adequate, relevant, and reasonably necessary in relation to the purposes for which such data is processed, as disclosed to the consumer.

(2) Except as otherwise provided in this article, a controller shall not process personal data for purposes that are neither reasonably necessary for nor compatible with the disclosed purposes for which the personal data is processed, unless the

controller obtains the consumer's consent.

(3) A controller shall establish, implement, and maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical data security practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of personal data. The data security practices required under this subdivision must be appropriate to the volume and nature of the personal data at issue.  
(4) A controller shall not process personal data in violation of state and federal laws that prohibit unlawful discrimination against consumers. A controller shall not discriminate against a consumer for exercising any of the consumer rights set forth in this article, including by denying goods or services to the consumer, charging different prices or rates for goods and services, or providing a different level or quality of goods or services to the consumer. However, nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to:

(A) require a controller to provide a product or service that requires the personal data of a consumer that the controller does not collect or maintain; or  
(B) prohibit a controller from offering a different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods or services for no fee, if the consumer has exercised the consumer's right to opt out under IC 24-15-3-1(b)(5) or if the offer is related to a consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discount, or club card program.  
(5) A controller shall not process sensitive data concerning a consumer without obtaining the consumer's consent, or, in the case of the processing of sensitive data concerning a known child, without processing such data in accordance with the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.).

Sec. 2. Any provision of a contract or agreement of any kind that purports to waive or limit in any way a consumer's rights under IC 24-15-3 is contrary to public policy and is void and unenforceable.

Sec. 3. A controller shall provide consumers with a reasonably accessible, clear, and meaningful privacy notice that includes:

(1) the categories of personal data processed by the controller;  
(2) the purpose for processing personal data;  
(3) how consumers may exercise their consumer rights under

IC 24-15-3, including how a consumer may appeal a controller's decision with regard to the consumer's request;

(4) the categories of personal data that the controller shares with third parties, if any; and  
(5) the categories of third parties, if any, with whom the controller shares personal data.

Sec. 4. If a controller sells a consumer's personal data to third parties or uses a consumer's personal data for targeted advertising, the controller shall clearly and conspicuously disclose such activity, as well as the manner in which a consumer may exercise the right to opt out of such sales or use.

Sec. 5. A controller shall establish, and shall describe in a privacy notice provided under section 3 of this chapter, one (1) or more secure and reliable means for consumers to submit a request to exercise their rights under IC 24-15-3. Such means must take into account:

(1) the ways in which consumers normally interact with the controller;  
(2) the need for the secure and reliable communication of such requests; and  
(3) the ability of the controller to authenticate the identity of the consumer making the request.

A controller may not require a consumer to create a new account in order to exercise the consumer's rights under IC 24-15-3 but may require a consumer to use an existing account.

Sec. 6. The attorney general may maintain on the attorney general's website a list of resources for controllers, including sample privacy notices and disclosures, to assist controllers in complying with this chapter.

Chapter 5. Responsibility According to Role; Controllers and Processors

Sec. 1. A processor shall adhere to the instructions of a controller and shall assist the controller in meeting its obligations under this chapter. Such assistance shall include the following:

(1) Assisting the controller in meeting the controller's obligation to respond to consumer requests under IC 24-15-3 by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is reasonably practicable, and taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor.  
(2) Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor, assisting the controller

in meeting the controller's obligations in relation to:

(A) the security of processing the personal data; and

(B) the notification of a breach of security of the system of the processor under IC 24-4.9;

in order to meet the controller's obligations.

(3) Providing necessary information to enable the controller to conduct and document data protection impact assessments under IC 24-15-6.

Sec. 2. (a) A contract between a controller and a processor shall govern the processor's data processing procedures with respect to processing performed on behalf of the controller. The contract must be binding and clearly set forth instructions for processing personal data, the nature and purpose of processing, the type of data subject to processing, the duration of processing, and the rights and obligations of both parties. The contract must also include requirements that the processor do the following:

(1) Ensure that each individual processing personal data is subject to a duty of confidentiality with respect to the data.  
(2) At the controller's direction, delete or return all personal data to the controller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal data is required by law.  
(3) Upon the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the controller all information in its possession necessary to demonstrate the processor's compliance with the obligations in this chapter.  
(4) Allow, and cooperate with, reasonable assessments by the controller or the controller's designated assessor. Alternatively, the processor may arrange for a qualified and independent assessor to conduct an assessment of the processor's policies and technical and organizational measures in support of the processor's obligations under this chapter using an appropriate and accepted control standard or framework and assessment procedure for such assessments. The processor shall provide a report of any such assessment to the controller upon request.  
(5) Subject to subsection (b), engage any subcontractor pursuant to a written contract that requires the subcontractor to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data.  
(b) Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve a controller or a processor from the liabilities imposed on the

controller or processor by virtue of its role in the processing relationship.

Sec. 3. Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or a processor with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact based determination that depends upon the context in which personal data is processed. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor.

Chapter 6. Data Protection Impact Assessments

Sec. 1. (a) The data protection impact assessment requirements set forth in this chapter apply to processing activities created or generated after December 31, 2025, and are not retroactive to any processing activities created or generated before January 1, 2026.

(b) A controller shall conduct and document a data protection impact assessment of each of the following processing activities involving personal data:

(1) The processing of personal data for purposes of targeted advertising.  
(2) The sale of personal data.  
(3) The processing of personal data for purposes of profiling, if such profiling presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of:

(A) unfair or deceptive treatment of, or unlawful disparate impact on, consumers;  
(B) financial, physical, or reputational injury to consumers;  
(C) a physical or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the private affairs or concerns, of consumers, if such intrusion would be offensive to a reasonable person; or  
(D) other substantial injury to consumers.

(4) The processing of sensitive data.  
(5) Any processing activities involving personal data that present a heightened risk of harm to consumers.  
(c) Data protection impact assessments conducted under this chapter shall identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and indirectly, from the processing to the controller, the consumer, other stakeholders, and the public against the potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with such processing, as mitigated by safeguards that can be employed by the controller to reduce such risks. The use of de-identified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well as the context of the processing and the relationship between the controller and the consumer

whose personal data will be processed, shall be factored into this assessment by the controller.

(d) A single data protection impact assessment may address a comparable set of processing operations that include similar activities.  
(e) A data protection impact assessment conducted by a controller for the purpose of compliance with other laws or regulations may be used to comply with this section if the assessment has a reasonably comparable scope and effect to an assessment conducted under this section.

Sec. 2. (a) The attorney general may request, pursuant to a civil investigative demand, that a controller disclose any data protection impact assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the attorney general. Upon receipt of such a request, the controller shall make the data protection impact assessment available to the attorney general. Subject to subsection (b), the attorney general may evaluate the data protection impact assessment for a controller's compliance with the responsibilities set forth in IC 24-15-4.

(b) Data protection impact assessments are confidential and exempt from public inspection and copying under IC 5-14-3-4. The disclosure of a data protection impact assessment pursuant to a request from the attorney general does not constitute a waiver of attorney-client privilege or work product protection with respect to the assessment and any information contained in the assessment.

Chapter 7. Processing De-identified Data or Pseudonymous Data; Exemptions

Sec. 1. (a) A controller in possession of de-identified data shall:

(1) take reasonable measures to ensure that the data cannot be associated with an individual;  
(2) publicly commit to maintaining and using de-identified data without attempting to re-identify the data; and  
(3) contractually obligate any recipients of the de-identified data to comply with all provisions of this chapter.

(b) This chapter shall not be construed to require a controller or processor to:

(1) re-identify de-identified data or pseudonymous data;  
(2) maintain data in identifiable form; or  
(3) collect, obtain, retain, or access any data or technology; in order to be capable of associating an authenticated consumer request with personal data.  
(c) This chapter shall not be construed to require a controller or

processor to comply with a request of a consumer under IC 24-15-3 if all of the following conditions are met:

(1) The controller is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the personal data or it would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate the request with the personal data.  
(2) The controller does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the specific consumer who is the subject of the personal data, or associate the personal data with other personal data about the same specific consumer.  
(3) The controller does not sell the personal data to any third party or otherwise voluntarily disclose the personal data to any third party other than a processor.

# Sec. 2. The:

(1) rights of a consumer set forth in IC 24-15-3-1(b)(1) through IC 24-15-3-1(b)(4); and  
(2) responsibilities of a controller under IC 24-15-4-1(1) through IC 24-15-4-1(5);

do not apply to pseudonymous data in any case in which the controller is able to demonstrate that any information necessary to identify the consumer is kept separately and is subject to effective technical and organizational controls that prevent the controller from accessing such information.

Sec. 3. A controller that discloses pseudonymous data or de-identified data shall exercise reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with any contractual commitments to which the pseudonymous data or de-identified data is subject and shall take appropriate steps to address any breaches of those contractual commitments.

# Chapter 8. Limitations

Sec. 1. (a) This article shall not be construed to restrict a controller's or processor's ability to do any of the following:

(1) Comply with federal, state, or local laws, rules, or regulations or, in the case of an owner of a riverboat licensed under IC 4-33-6, implement and operate a facial recognition program approved by the Indiana gaming commission.  
(2) Comply with a civil, criminal, or regulatory inquiry, investigation, subpoena, or summons by a federal, state, local, or other governmental authority.  
(3) Cooperate with law enforcement agencies concerning conduct or activity that the controller or processor reasonably and in good faith believes may violate federal, state, or local

laws, rules, or regulations.

(4) Investigate, establish, exercise, prepare for, or defend legal claims.  
(5) Provide a product or service specifically requested by a consumer, perform a contract to which the consumer, or a parent of a child, is a party, including fulfilling the terms of a written warranty, or take steps at the request of the consumer or parent before entering into a contract.  
(6) Take immediate steps to protect an interest that is essential for the life or physical safety of the consumer or of another individual, if the processing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis.  
(7) Prevent, detect, protect against, or respond to security incidents, identity theft, fraud, harassment, malicious or deceptive activities, or any illegal activity, investigate, report, or prosecute those responsible for any such action, and preserve the integrity or security of systems.  
(8) Engage in public or peer reviewed scientific or statistical research that is in the public interest and that adheres to all applicable ethics and privacy laws and is approved, monitored, and governed by an institutional review board, or a similar independent oversight entity, that determines if:

(A) the information is likely to provide substantial benefits that do not exclusively accrue to the controller;

(B) the expected benefits of the research outweigh the privacy risks; and

(C) the controller has implemented reasonable safeguards to mitigate privacy risks associated with research, including any risks associated with re-identification.

(9) Assist another controller, processor, or third party with any obligation described in this section.

(b) Processing personal data for a purpose expressly identified in subsection (a)(1) through (a)(9) does not by itself make a person a controller with respect to such processing.

Sec. 2. The obligations imposed on a controller or a processor under this article do not prohibit or restrict a controller or processor from collecting, using, or retaining data to do the following:

(1) Conduct internal research to develop, improve, or repair products, services, or technology.  
(2) Effectuate a product recall.  
(3) Identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or

intended functionality.

(4) Perform internal operations that are:

(A) reasonably compatible with the expectations of the consumer;  
(B) reasonably anticipated based on the consumer's existing relationship with the controller; or  
(C) otherwise compatible with:

(i) processing data in furtherance of the provision of a product or service specifically requested by a consumer, or the parent of a child; or  
(ii) the performance of a contract to which the consumer is a party.

Sec. 3. The obligations imposed on a controller or a processor under this article do not apply if compliance by the controller or processor with this article would violate an evidentiary privilege under Indiana law. This article shall not be construed to prohibit a controller or processor from providing, as part of a privileged communication, personal data concerning a consumer to a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under Indiana law.

Sec. 4. A controller or processor that discloses personal data to a third party controller or processor in compliance with this article is not in violation of this article if the third party controller or processor that receives and processes the personal data violates this article, as long as, at the time of disclosing the personal data, the disclosing controller or processor did not have actual knowledge that the recipient intended to commit a violation. A third party controller or processor receiving personal data from a controller or processor is likewise not in violation of this article solely because of the transgressions of the controller or processor from which it receives such personal data.

Sec. 5. This article:

(1) shall not be construed as an obligation imposed on controllers and processors that adversely affects the rights or freedoms of any persons, such as exercising the right of free speech under the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States; and  
(2) does not apply to personal data in the context of a purely personal or household activity.

Sec. 6. Nothing in this article shall be construed as requiring a controller to disclose trade secrets.  
Sec. 7. (a) Personal data processed by a controller for a purpose authorized under this chapter may not be processed for any other

purpose unless otherwise allowed under this article. Personal data processed by a controller under this chapter may be processed to the extent that such processing is:

(1) reasonably necessary and proportionate to a purpose authorized under this chapter; and  
(2) adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the specific purpose.  
(b) Personal data collected, used, or retained under section 2 of this chapter:  
(1) shall, as applicable, take into account the nature and purpose of the collection, use, or retention; and  
(2) must be subject to reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to:

(A) protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of the personal data; and  
(B) reduce reasonably foreseeable risks of harm to consumers relating to such collection, use, or retention of the personal data.

(c) If a controller processes personal data pursuant to an exemption under this chapter, the controller bears the burden of demonstrating that such processing:

(1) qualifies for the exemption; and  
(2) complies with the requirements set forth in this section.

the attorney general shall not initiate an action against the controller or processor.

(b) If a controller or processor:

(1) continues the alleged violation following the thirty (30) day period set forth in subsection (a); or  
(2) breaches an express written statement provided to the attorney general under subsection (a)(2);

the attorney general may initiate an action under section 2 of this chapter.

Sec. 4. Nothing in this article shall be construed as providing the basis for a private right of action for violations of this article or any other law.

Chapter 11. Preemption; Other Laws

Sec. 1. This article supersedes and preempts all rules, regulations, codes, ordinances, and other laws adopted by a city, county, city and county, municipality, or local agency regarding the processing of personal data by controllers or processors.  
Sec. 2. Any reference to federal, state, or local law or statute in this article includes any accompanying rules, regulations, or exemptions.
