(iv) the agency has taken reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information it discloses will not be held, used or disclosed by the recipient of the information in a way that is inconsistent with the QPPs.

# Part 3 Compliance with parts 1 and 2 and s 41 by contracted service providers

# 34 Meaning of service arrangement

(1) In this Act, a service arrangement is a contract or other arrangement entered into after the commencement of this section under which an entity other than an agency (the contracted service provider) agrees or otherwise arranges with an agency (the contracting agency) to provide services.  
(2) For subsection (1)

(a) the services must be for the purposes of the performance of 1 or more of the contracting agency's functions; and  
(b) the services must be provided either

(i) directly to the contracting agency; or  
(ii) to another entity on the contracting agency's behalf; and

(c) the contracted service provider must not be in the capacity of employee of the contracting agency in providing the services.

# 35 Binding a contracted service provider to privacy principle requirements

(1) An agency entering into a service arrangement must take all reasonable steps to ensure that the contracted service provider is required to comply with parts 1 and 2 and section 41, as if it

were the agency, in relation to the discharge of its obligations under the arrangement.

(2) However, the agency must comply with subsection (1) only if

(a) the contracted service provider will in any way deal with personal information for the contracting agency; or  
(b) the provision of services under the arrangement will involve—

(i) the transfer of personal information to the contracting agency; or  
(ii) the provision of services to a third party for the contracting agency.

(3) The agency is not required to comply with subsection (1) if—

(a) the contracted service provider is to receive funding from the contracting agency; and  
(b) the contracted service provider will not collect personal information for the contracting agency; and  
(c) the contracted service provider will not receive any personal information from the contracting agency for the purposes of discharging its obligations; and  
(d) the contracted service provider will not be required to give the contracting agency any personal information it collects in discharging its obligations.

(4) Subsections (1) to (3) are not intended to limit what may be provided for in a service arrangement about the contracted service provider's collection, storage, handling, accessing, amendment, management, transfer, use or disclosure of personal information, whether or not the contracted service provider is a bound contracted service provider.

# 36 Bound contracted service provider to comply with privacy principle requirements

(1) A bound contracted service provider under a service arrangement must comply with parts 1 and 2 and section 41 in

relation to the discharge of its obligations under the arrangement as if it were the entity that is the contracting agency.

(2) The requirement to comply under subsection (1) continues to apply to the bound contracted service provider in relation to personal information it continues to hold after its obligations under the service arrangement otherwise end.  
(3) A bound contracted service provider's compliance with the privacy principle requirements may be enforced under this Act as if it were an agency.  
(4) Subsections (1) to (3) are not intended to prevent a service arrangement from including a requirement for the contracted service provider to comply with all or part of the privacy principles even though this part does not require that the service arrangement include the requirement.

# 37 Contracting agency to comply with privacy principles if contracted service provider not bound

(1) This section applies if a contracted service provider under a service arrangement is not a bound contracted service provider because the contracting agency under the service arrangement did not take the steps required of it under section 35.  
(2) The obligations that would attach to the contracted service provider if it were a bound contracted service provider attach instead to the contracting agency under the arrangement.
