	6.3	If the organisation is not required to provide the individual with access to the information because of one or more of IPP 6.1(a) to (j) (inclusive), the organisation must, if reasonable, consider whether the use of mutually agreed intermediaries would allow sufficient access to meet the needs of both parties.

	6.7	An organisation must provide reasons for denial of access or a refusal to correct personal information.

	(a)	the organisation reasonably believes that the recipient of the information is subject to a law, binding scheme or contract which effectively upholds principles for fair handling of the information that are substantially similar to the Information Privacy Principles; or
	(b)	the individual consents to the transfer; or
	(c)	the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the individual and the organisation, or for the implementation of precontractual measures taken in response to the individual's request; or
	(d)	the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in the interest of the individual between the organisation and a third party; or
