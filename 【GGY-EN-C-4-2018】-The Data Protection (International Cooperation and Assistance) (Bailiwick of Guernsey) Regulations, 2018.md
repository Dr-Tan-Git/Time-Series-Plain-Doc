# EXPLANATORY NOTE

(This note is not part of the Regulations)

These Regulations are made under the Data Protection (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 2017 ("the Law"). These Regulations confer additional functions on the Authority in relation to international co-operation and international mutual assistance, in connection with the GDPR and the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (1981).

Regulation 1 requires the Authority to have particular regard to articles 60 (cooperation between the lead supervisory authority and the other supervisory authorities concerned), 61 (mutual assistance) and 62 (joint operations of supervisory authorities) of the GDPR when performing its functions under section 65 of the Data Protection Law. So far as appropriate and consistent with its other functions under the Law, the Authority is required to act in a manner consistent with those provisions of the GDPR.

Regulation 2 requires the Authority, on request by a foreign supervisory authority, to provide that foreign supervisory authority with information on the Law and the Authority's administrative practices, as well as to take steps to obtain factual information relating to any processing of personal data carried out in the Bailiwick. The Authority is authorised to make a similar request to a foreign supervisory authority.

Regulation 3 requires the Authority, on request by an individual who is not a Bailiwick resident, to assist the individual to exercise a right protected by the Convention or a data subject right under the Law against a controller established in the Bailiwick.

Regulation 4 requires the Authority, on request by a Bailiwick resident, to assist that resident to exercise, in a country outside the Bailiwick, a right protected by the

Convention, a data subject right under the Law or a right conferred by the GDPR or required to be conferred by the Law Enforcement Directive. In this case, the Authority is required to submit the request to the supervisory authority of the country concerned.

Regulation 5 prohibits the Authority from using any information provided by a foreign supervisory authority as a result of a request made by or to the Authority under these Regulations for any purpose other than the purpose specified in the request.

Regulation 6 sets out the interpretation provisions. Regulations 7 and 8 are the citation and commencement provisions, respectively.

These Regulations come into force on the  $25^{\mathrm{th}}$  May, 2018.
