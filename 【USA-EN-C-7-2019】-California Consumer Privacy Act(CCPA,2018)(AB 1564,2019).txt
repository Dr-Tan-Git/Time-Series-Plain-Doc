LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST

AB 1564, Berman. Consumer privacy: consumer request for disclosure methods.
Existing law, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, commencing January 1, 2020, grants a consumer various rights with regard to the consumer’s personal information that a business collects, discloses for a business purpose, or sells. Among these rights, the act authorizes a consumer to request that a business that collects, discloses for a business purpose, or sells the consumer’s personal information to disclose to the consumer specified information related to those activities. The act imposes certain responsibilities on the Attorney General in connection with the act, including the creation of regulations and providing guidance on how to comply with the act.
The act provides that an above-described business is required, in a form that is reasonably accessible to consumers, to make available to consumers 2 or more designated methods for submitting requests for specified information required to be disclosed, including, at a minimum, a toll-free telephone number, and, if the business maintains an internet website, a website address.
This bill would provide that a business that operates exclusively online and has a direct relationship with a consumer from whom it collects personal information is only required to provide an email address for submitting requests for information required to be disclosed, as specified. The bill would, if the business maintains an internet website, require the business to make the internet website address available to consumers to submit requests for information required to be disclosed, as specified.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 1798.130 of the Civil Code proposed by AB 25 and AB 1355 to be operative only if either or both of those bills are enacted and this bill is enacted last.

SECTION 1. Section 1798.130 of the Civil Code is amended to read:

1798.130. (a) In order to comply with Sections 1798.100, 1798.105, 1798.110, 1798.115, and 1798.125, a business shall, in a form that is reasonably accessible to consumers:
(1) (A) Make available to consumers two or more designated methods for submitting requests for information required to be disclosed pursuant to Sections 1798.110 and 1798.115, including, at a minimum, a toll-free telephone number. A business that operates exclusively online and has a direct relationship with a consumer from whom it collects personal information shall only be required to provide an email address for submitting requests for information required to be disclosed pursuant to Sections 1798.110 and 1798.115.

(2) Disclose and deliver the required information to a consumer free of charge within 45 days of receiving a verifiable consumer request from the consumer. The business shall promptly take steps to determine whether the request is a verifiable consumer request, but this shall not extend the business’ duty to disclose and deliver the information within 45 days of receipt of the consumer’s request. The time period to provide the required information may be extended once by an additional 45 days when reasonably necessary, provided the consumer is provided notice of the extension within the first 45-day period. The disclosure shall cover the 12-month period preceding the business’s receipt of the verifiable consumer request and shall be made in writing and delivered through the consumer’s account with the business, if the consumer maintains an account with the business, or by mail or electronically at the consumer’s option if the consumer does not maintain an account with the business, in a readily useable format that allows the consumer to transmit this information from one entity to another entity without hindrance. The business shall not require the consumer to create an account with the business in order to make a verifiable consumer request.
