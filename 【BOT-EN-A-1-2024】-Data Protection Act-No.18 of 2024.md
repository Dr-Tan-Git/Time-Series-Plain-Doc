# PART XI - Security of Personal Data

62. (1) The data controller and the data processor shall, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing and the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including as appropriate —

(a) the pseudonymisation or encryption of personal data;  
(b) the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services;  
(c) the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; and  
(d) a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.  
(2) In assessing the appropriate level of security, account shall be taken of the risks that are presented by processing, including accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.  
(3) Adherence to an approved code of conduct under section 73 may be used to demonstrate compliance with the requirements set out in this section.

Appropriate technical and organisational measures

Notification of personal data breach

(4) The data controller and data processor shall take steps to ensure that any natural person acting under the authority of the data controller or the data processor who has access to personal data does not process them except on instructions from the data controller, unless he or she is required to do so by law under section 50.  
63. (1) In the case of a personal data breach, the data controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the Commission, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject.  
(2) Where the notification under subsection (1) is not made within 72 hours, it shall be accompanied by reasons for the delay.  
(3) The data processor shall notify the data controller without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data breach.  
(4) The notification under subsection (1) shall —  
(a) describe the nature of the personal data breach, including where possible, the categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned and the categories and approximate number of personal data records concerned;  
(b) communicate the name and contact details of the data protection officer or other contact point where more information can be obtained;  
(c) describe the likely consequences of the personal data breach; and  
(d) describe the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the data controller to address the personal data breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.  
(5) Where, and insofar as, it is not possible to provide the information at the same time, the information may be provided in phases without undue further delay.  
(6) The data controller shall document any personal data breaches, comprising the facts relating to the personal data breach, its effects and the remedial action taken.  
(7) The documentation in subsection (5) shall be provided in such manner as to enable the Commission to verify compliance with this section, as the Commission may determine.  
64. (1) Where a personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data controller shall communicate the personal data breach to the data subject without undue delay.  
(2) The communication to the data subject under subsection (1) shall describe in clear and plain language the nature of the personal data breach and contain the information and measures under section 63 (4)  $(b)$  to  $(d)$ .  
(3) The communication to the data subject under subsection (1) shall not be required if any of the following conditions are met —

Communication of personal data breach to data subject

(a) the data controller has implemented appropriate technical and organisational protection measures, and those measures were applied to the personal data affected by the personal data breach, in particular those that render the personal data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it, such as encryption;  
(b) the data controller has taken subsequent measures which ensure that the high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects in subsection (1) is no longer likely to materialise; or  
(c) it would involve disproportionate effort:

Provided that there shall, instead, be a public communication or similar measure whereby the data subjects are informed in an equally effective manner.

(4) Where the data controller fails to inform the data subject of the personal data breach, the Commission, having considered the likelihood of the personal data breach resulting in a high risk, may require the data controller to do so or may decide that any of the conditions under subsection (3) are nonetheless met.

# PART XII - Data Protection Impact Assessment and Prior Consultation

65. (1) Where a type of processing uses new technologies, and taking into account the nature, scope, context and purpose of processing, is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data controller shall, prior to processing, carry out an assessment of the impact of the envisaged processing operations on the protection of personal data:

Provided that a single assessment may address a set of similar processing operations that present similar high risks.

(2) The data controller shall seek the advice of the data protection officer, where designated, when carrying out a data protection impact assessment.  
(3) A data protection impact assessment under subsection (1) shall be required where  
(a) a systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural persons is based on automated processing, including profiling, and decisions that produce legal effects concerning the natural person or significantly affect the natural person;  
(b) processing of sensitive personal data or personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences under section 30 or 32 is carried out on a large scale; or

(4) Sections 65 to 67 shall not apply where  
(a) processing is carried out pursuant to section 26 (c) or (e), and the law regulates the specific processing operation or set of operations in question; and  
(b) a data protection impact assessment has been carried out as part of a general impact assessment in the context of the adoption of that law.  
(5) The data controller shall, when there is a change in the risk represented by processing operations, carry out a review of the risk in accordance with section 65.

Prior consultation

68. (1) Where a data protection impact assessment under section 65 indicates that, in the absence of measures to mitigate the risk, processing would result in a high risk, the data controller shall consult the Commission prior to processing.

(2) Where the Commission considers that the intended processing under subsection (1) would contravene this Act, and that the data controller has insufficiently identified or mitigated the risk, the Commission —
