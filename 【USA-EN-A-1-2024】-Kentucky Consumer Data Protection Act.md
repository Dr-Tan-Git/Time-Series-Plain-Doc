$\rightarrow$ SECTION 3. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 367 IS CREATED TO READ AS FOLLOWS:

(1) A consumer may invoke the consumer rights authorized pursuant to this section at any time by submitting a request to a controller, via the means specified by the controller pursuant to Section 4 of this Act, specifying the consumer rights the consumer wishes to invoke. A child's parent or legal guardian may invoke such consumer rights on behalf of the child regarding processing personal data belonging to the child.

(2) A controller shall comply with an authenticated consumer request to exercise the right to:

(a) Confirm whether or not a controller is processing the consumer's personal data and to access the personal data, unless the confirmation and access would require the controller to reveal a trade secret;  
(b) Correct inaccuracies in the consumer's personal data, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the purposes of processing the data;  
(c) Delete personal data provided by or obtained about the consumer;  
(d) Obtain a copy of the consumer's personal data that the consumer previously provided to the controller in a portable and, to the extent technically practicable, readily usable format that allows the consumer to transmit the

data to another controller without hindrance, where the processing is carried out by automated means. The controller shall not be required to reveal any trade secrets; and

(e) To opt out of the processing of personal data for purposes of targeted advertising, the sale of personal data, or profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning the consumer.

(3) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 1 to 10 of this Act, a controller shall comply with a request by a consumer to exercise the consumer rights pursuant to this section as follows:

(a) A controller shall respond to the consumer without undue delay, but in all cases within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the request submitted pursuant to the methods described in this section. The response period may be extended once by forty-five (45) additional days when reasonably necessary, taking into consideration the complexity and number of the consumer's requests, so long as the controller informs the consumer of any extension within the initial forty-five (45) day response period, together with the reason for the extension;  
(b) If a controller declines to take action regarding the consumer's request, the controller shall inform the consumer without undue delay, but no later than forty-five (45) days after receipt of the request, of the justification for declining to take action and instructions on how to appeal the decision;  
(c) Information provided in response to a consumer request shall be provided by a controller free of charge, up to twice annually per consumer. If requests from a consumer are excessive, repetitive, technically infeasible, or manifestly unfounded, the controller may charge the consumer a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying with the

request or decline to act on the request. The controller bears the burden of demonstrating the excessive, repetitive, technically infeasible, or manifestly unfounded nature of the request;

(d) If a controller is unable to authenticate the request using commercially reasonable efforts, the controller shall not be required to comply with a request to initiate an action under subsection (1) of this section and may request that the consumer provide additional information reasonably necessary to authenticate the consumer and the consumer's request; and  
(e) A controller that has obtained personal data about a consumer from a source other than the consumer shall be deemed in compliance with a consumer's request to delete such data pursuant to subsection (2)(c) of this section by:

1. Retaining a record of the deletion request and the minimum data necessary for the purpose of ensuring the consumer's personal data remains deleted from the business' records and not using the retained data for any other purpose pursuant to the provisions of Sections 1 to 10 of this Act; or  
2. Opting the consumer out of the processing of the personal data for any purpose except for those exempted pursuant to Section 2 of this Act.

(4) A controller shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal the controller's refusal to take action on a request within a reasonable period of time after the consumer's receipt of the decision pursuant to subsection (3)(b) of this section. The appeal process shall be conspicuously available and similar to the process for submitting requests to initiate action pursuant to this section. Within sixty (60) days of receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written

explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the consumer with an online mechanism, if available, or other method through which the consumer may contact the Attorney General to submit a complaint.

$\rightarrow$  SECTION 4. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 367 IS CREATED TO READ AS FOLLOWS:

(1) A controller shall:

(a) Limit the collection of personal data to what is adequate, relevant, and reasonably necessary in relation to the purposes for which the data is processed as disclosed to the consumer;  
(b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, not process personal data for purposes that are neither reasonably necessary to nor compatible with the disclosed purposes for which the personal data is processed as disclosed to the consumer, unless the controller obtains the consumer's consent;  
(c) Establish, implement, and maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical data security practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of personal data. The data security practices shall be appropriate to the volume and nature of the personal data at issue;  
(d) Not process personal data in violation of state and federal laws that prohibit unlawful discrimination against consumers. A controller shall not discriminate against a consumer for exercising any of the consumer rights contained in Section 3 of this Act, including denying goods or services, charging different prices or rates for goods or services, or providing a different level of quality of goods and services to the consumer. However, nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require a controller to provide a product or service that requires the personal data of a consumer that the controller does not collect or maintain, or to prohibit a controller

from offering a different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods or services for no fee, if the offer is related to a consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts, or club card program; and

(e) Not process sensitive data concerning a consumer without obtaining the consumer's consent, or, in the case of the processing of sensitive data collected from a known child, process the data in accordance with the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act 15 U.S.C. sec. 6501 et seq.

(2) Any provision of a contract or agreement of any kind that purports to waive or limit in any way consumer rights pursuant to Section 3 of this Act shall be deemed contrary to public policy and shall be void and unenforceable.  
(3) Controllers shall provide consumers with a reasonably accessible, clear, and meaningful privacy notice that includes:

(a) The categories of personal data processed by the controller;  
(b) The purpose for processing personal data;  
(c) How consumers may exercise their consumer rights pursuant to Section 3 of this Act, including how a consumer may appeal a controller's decision with regard to the consumer's request;  
(d) The categories of personal data that the controller shares with third parties, if any; and  
(e) The categories of third parties, if any, with whom the controller shares personal data.

(4) If a controller sells personal data to third parties or processes personal data for targeted advertising, the controller shall clearly and conspicuously disclose such activity, as well as the manner in which a consumer may exercise the right to opt out of processing.  
(5) A controller shall establish, and shall describe in a privacy notice, one (1) or

more secure and reliable means for consumers to submit a request to exercise their consumer rights under Section 3 of this Act. The different ways to submit a request by a consumer shall take into account the ways in which consumers normally interact with the controller, the need for secure and reliable communication of such requests, and the ability of the controller to authenticate the identity of the consumer making the request. Controllers shall not require a consumer to create a new account in order to exercise consumer rights pursuant to Section 3 of this Act but may require a consumer to use an existing account.

$\rightarrow$ SECTION 5. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 367 IS CREATED TO READ AS FOLLOWS:

(1) A processor shall adhere to the instructions of a controller and shall assist the controller in meeting its obligations under Section 1 to 10 of this Act. Such assistance shall include:

(a) Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor, by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is reasonably practicable, to fulfill the controller's obligation to respond to consumer rights requests pursuant to Section 3 of this Act;  
(b) Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor, by assisting the controller in meeting the controller's obligations in relation to the security of processing the personal data and in relation to the notification of a breach of the security of the system of the processor pursuant to KRS 365.732; and  
(c) Providing necessary information to enable the controller to conduct and document data protection assessments pursuant to Section 6 of this Act.

(2) A contract between a controller and a processor shall govern the processor's data processing procedures with respect to processing performed on behalf of the controller. The contract shall be binding and shall clearly set forth instructions

for processing personal data, the nature and purpose of processing, the type of data subject to processing, the duration of processing, and the rights and obligations of both parties. The contract shall also include requirements that the processor shall:

(a) Ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of confidentiality with respect to the data;  
(b) At the controller's direction, delete or return all personal data to the controller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal data is required by law;  
(c) Upon the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the controller all information in its possession necessary to demonstrate the processor's compliance with the obligations prescribed in Sections 1 to 10 of this Act;  
(d) Allow, and cooperate with, reasonable assessments by the controller or the controller's designated assessor. Alternatively, the processor may arrange for a qualified and independent assessor to conduct an assessment of the processor's policies and technical and organizational measures in support of the obligations in Sections 1 to 10 of this Act using an appropriate and accepted control standard or framework and assessment procedure for assessments. The processor shall provide a report of the assessment to the controller upon request; and  
(d) Engage any subcontractor pursuant to a written contract in accordance with this section that requires the subcontractor to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data.

(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve a controller or processor from the liabilities imposed on it by virtue of its role in a processing relationship as defined by Sections 1 to 10 of this Act.

(4) Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that depends upon the context in which personal data is to be processed. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor.

$\rightarrow$ SECTION 6. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 367 IS CREATED TO READ AS FOLLOWS:

(1) Controllers shall conduct and document a data protection impact assessment of each of the following processing activities involving personal data:

(a) The processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising;  
(b) The processing of personal data for the purposes of selling of personal data;  
(c) The processing of personal data for the purposes of profiling, where the profiling presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of:

1. Unfair or deceptive treatment of consumers or disparate impact on consumers;  
2. Financial, physical, or reputational injury to consumers;  
3. A physical or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the private affairs or concerns, of consumers, where an intrusion would be offensive to a reasonable person; or  
4. Other substantial injury to consumers;

(d) The processing of sensitive data; and  
(e) Any processing of personal data that presents a heightened risk of harm to consumers.

(2) Data protection impact assessments conducted under this section shall identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and indirectly, from the processing to the controller, the consumer, other stakeholders, and the public against the potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with such processing, as

mitigated by safeguards that can be employed by the controller to reduce such risk. The use of de-identified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well as the context of the processing of personal data and the relationship between the controller and the consumer whose personal data will be processed, shall be factored into this assessment by the controller.

(3) The Attorney General may request, pursuant to an investigative demand, that a controller disclose any data protection impact assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the Attorney General, and the controller shall make the data protection impact assessment available to the Attorney General. The Attorney General may evaluate the data protection impact assessments for compliance with the requirements of Sections 1 to 10 of this Act.  
(4) Data protection impact assessments are confidential and exempt from disclosure, public inspection, and copying under KRS 61.870 to KRS 61.884.  
(5) The disclosure of a data protection impact assessment pursuant to a request from the Attorney General under subsection (3) of this section does not constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege or work product protection with respect to the assessment and any information contained in the assessment.  
(6) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of processing operations that include similar activities.  
(7) Data protection assessments conducted by a controller for the purpose of compliance with other laws or regulations may comply under this section if the assessments have a reasonably comparable scope and effect.  
(8) Data protection assessment requirements shall apply to processing activities created or generated on or after June 1, 2026.

$\rightarrow$  SECTION 7. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 367 IS CREATED TO READ AS FOLLOWS:

(1) The controller in possession of de-identified data shall:

(a) Take reasonable measures to ensure the data cannot be associated with a natural person;  
(b) Publicly commit to maintaining and using de-identified data without attempting to re-identify the data; and  
(c) Contractually obligate any recipients of the de-identified data to comply with all provisions of Sections 1 to 10 of this Act.

(2) Nothing in Sections 1 to 10 of this Act shall be construed to require a controller or processor to:

(a) Re-identify de-identified data or pseudonymous data; or  
(b) Maintain data in identifiable form, or collect, obtain, retain, or access any data or technology, in order to be capable of associating an authenticated consumer request with personal data.

(3) Nothing in Sections 1 to 10 of this Act shall be construed to require a controller or processor to comply with an authenticated consumer rights request pursuant to Section 3 of this Act if:

(a) The controller is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the personal data or it would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate the request with the personal data;  
(b) The controller does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the specific consumer who is the subject of the personal data, or associate the personal data with other personal data about the same specific consumer; and  
(c) The controller does not sell the personal data to any third party or otherwise voluntarily disclose the personal data to any third party other than a processor, except as otherwise permitted in this section.

(4) The consumer rights contained in Section 3 of this Act shall not apply to pseudonymous data in cases where the controller is able to demonstrate any

information necessary to identify the consumer is kept separately and is subject to appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data is not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.

(5) A controller that discloses pseudonymous data or de-identified data shall exercise reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with any contractual commitments to which the pseudonymous data or de-identified data is subject and shall take appropriate steps to address any breaches of those contractual commitments.

$\rightarrow$ SECTION 8. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 367 IS CREATED TO READ AS FOLLOWS:

1. If the deletion of the information is likely to provide substantial benefits that do not exclusively accrue to the controller;  
2. The expected benefits of the research outweigh the privacy risks; and  
3. If the controller has implemented reasonable safeguards to mitigate privacy risks associated with research, including any risks associated with re-identification; or

(i) Assist another controller, processor, or third party with any of the obligations under this subsection.

(2) The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under Sections 1 to 10 of this Act shall not restrict a controller's or processor's ability to collect, use, or retain data to:

(a) Conduct internal research to develop, improve, or repair products, services, or technology;  
(b) Effectuate a product recall;  
(c) Identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended functionality; or  
(d) Perform internal operations that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the consumer or reasonably anticipated based on the

consumer's existing relationship with the controller or are otherwise compatible with processing data in furtherance of the provision of a product or service specifically requested by a consumer or a parent or guardian of a known child or the performance of a contract to which the consumer or a parent or guardian of a known child is a party.

(3) The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under Sections 1 to 10 of this Act shall not apply to a controller or processor if compliance under Sections 1 to 10 of this Act would violate an evidentiary privilege under the laws of this Commonwealth. Nothing in Sections 1 to 10 of this Act shall be construed to prevent a controller or processor from providing personal data concerning a consumer to a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under the laws of this Commonwealth as part of a privileged communication.

(4) A controller or processor that discloses personal data to a third-party controller or processor, in compliance with the requirements of Sections 1 to 10 of this Act, is not in violation of Sections 1 to 10 of this Act if the third-party controller or processor that receives and processes such personal data is in violation of Sections 1 to 10 of this Act, provided that, at the time of disclosing the personal data, the disclosing controller or processor did not have actual knowledge that the recipient intended to commit a violation. A third-party controller or processor receiving personal data from a controller or processor in compliance with the requirements of Sections 1 to 10 of this Act is likewise not in violation of Sections 1 to 10 of this Act for the transgressions of the controller or processor from which it receives such personal data.

(5) Nothing in Sections 1 to 10 of this Act shall be construed as an obligation imposed on controllers and processors that adversely affects the privacy or other rights or freedoms of any persons, including but not limited to the right of free speech pursuant to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, or

applies to personal data by a person in the course of a purely personal or household activity.

(6) Personal data processed by a controller pursuant to this section shall not be processed for any purpose other than those expressly listed in this section unless otherwise allowed by Sections 1 to 10 of this Act. Personal data processed by a controller pursuant to this section may be processed to the extent that such processing is:

(a) Reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes listed in this section; and

(b) Adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the specific purposes listed in this section. Personal data collected, used, or retained pursuant to subsection (2) of this section shall, where applicable, take into account the nature and purpose or purposes of such collection, use, or retention. The data shall be subject to reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of personal data and to reduce reasonably foreseeable risks of harm to consumers relating to the collection, use, or retention of personal data.

(7) If a controller processes personal data pursuant to an exemption in this section, the controller bears the burden of demonstrating that such processing qualifies for the exemption and complies with the requirements in this section.  
(8) Processing personal data for the purposes expressly identified in subsection (1) of this section shall not by itself make an entity a controller with respect to such processing.

$\rightarrow$ SECTION 9. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 367 IS CREATED TO READ AS FOLLOWS:

(1) The Attorney General shall have exclusive authority to enforce violations of

Sections 1 to 10 of this Act. The Attorney General may enforce Sections 1 to 10 of this Act by bringing an action in the name of the Commonwealth of Kentucky or on behalf of persons residing in this Commonwealth. The Attorney General shall have all powers and duties granted to the Attorney General under KRS Chapter 15 to investigate and prosecute any violation of Sections 1 to 10 of this Act. The Attorney General may demand any information, documentary material, or physical evidence from any controller or processor believed to be engaged in, or about to engage in, any violation of Sections 1 to 10 of this Act.

(2) Prior to initiating any action for violation of Sections 1 to 10 of this Act, the Attorney General shall provide a controller or processor thirty (30) days' written notice identifying the specific provisions of Sections 1 to 10 of this Act, the Attorney General alleges have been or are being violated. If within the thirty (30) days the controller or processor cures the noticed violation and provides the Attorney General an express written statement that the alleged violations have been cured and that no further violations shall occur, no action for damages under subsection (3) of this section shall be initiated against the controller or processor.  
(3) If a controller or processor continues to violate Sections 1 to 10 of this Act following the cure period in subsection (2) of this section or breaches an express written statement provided to the Attorney General under subsection (2) of this section, the Attorney General may initiate an action and seek damages for up to seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500) for each continued violation under Sections 1 to 10 of this Act.  
(4) Nothing in Sections 1 to 10 of this Act or any other law, regulation, or the equivalent shall be construed as providing the basis for, or give rise to, a private right of action for violations of Sections 1 to 10 of this Act.  
(5) The Attorney General may recover reasonable expenses incurred in investigating

and preparing the case, court costs, attorney's fees, and any other relief ordered by the court of any action initiated under Sections 1 to 10 of this Act.

$\rightarrow$ SECTION 10. A NEW SECTION OF KRS CHAPTER 367 IS CREATED TO READ AS FOLLOWS:

There is hereby created a trust and agency account to be known as the consumer privacy fund. The fund shall be administered by the Office of the Attorney General. All civil penalties collected pursuant to Sections 1 to 10 of this Act shall be deposited into the fund. Interest earned on moneys in the fund shall accrue to the fund. Moneys in the fund shall be used by the Office of the Attorney General to enforce Sections 1 to 10 of this Act. Notwithstanding KRS 45.229, any moneys remaining in the fund at the close of the fiscal year shall not lapse but shall be carried forward into the succeeding fiscal year to be used by the Office of the Attorney General for the purposes set forth in Sections 1 to 10 of this Act.
