(b) is of Special Categories of Personal Data, and  
(c) is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest,

subject to subsections (2) and (3).

(2) Subsection (3) applies where—

(b) the Data Subject does not have and is not expected to acquire—

(i) rights against, or obligations in relation to, a person who is an insured person under an insurance contract to which the insurance purpose mentioned in subsection (1)(a) relates, or  
(ii) other rights or obligations in connection with such a contract.

(3) Where this subsection applies, the Processing does not meet the condition in subsection (1) unless, in addition to meeting the requirements in that subsection—

(a) the Controller cannot reasonably be expected to obtain the Consent of the Data Subject, and  
(b) the Controller is not aware of the Data Subject withholding Consent.

(5) The reference in subsection (3)(b) to a Data Subject withholding Consent does not include a Data Subject merely failing to respond to a request for Consent.

# 4. Condition related to the safeguarding of children and of individuals at risk

(1) This condition is met if—

(b) in the circumstances, the Controller cannot reasonably be expected to obtain the Consent of the Data Subject to the Processing; or
