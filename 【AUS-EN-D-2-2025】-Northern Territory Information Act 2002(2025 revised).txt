(i)	making available to the public information about the operations of public sector organisations and, in particular, ensuring that rules and practices affecting members of the public in their dealings with public sector organisations are readily available to persons affected by those rules and practices; and
(ii)	creating a general right of access to information held by public sector organisations limited only in those circumstances where the disclosure of particular information would be contrary to the public interest because its disclosure would have a prejudicial effect on essential public interests or on the private and business interests of persons in respect of whom information is held by public sector organisations; and
(b)	to protect the privacy of personal information held by public sector organisations by:
(i)	providing individuals with a right of access to, and a right to request correction of, their personal information held by public sector organisations; and

	(3)	This Act:
(a)	does not replace other procedures for accessing government information; and

Note 1:	It is not intended to deter public sector organisations from lawfully co-operating with law enforcement agencies in the performance of their functions.
Note 2:	IPP 2.1 does not override any existing legal obligations not to disclose personal information. IPP 2.1 does not require a public sector organisation to disclose personal information - a public sector organisation is always entitled not to disclose personal information in the absence of a legal obligation to disclose it.

5.2	On the request of an individual, a public sector organisation must take reasonable steps to inform the individual of the kind of personal information it holds, why it holds the information and how it collects, holds, uses and discloses the information.
IPP 6	Access and correction
6.1	If an individual requests a public sector organisation holding personal information about the individual for access to the personal information, the organisation must provide the individual with access to the information except to the extent that:

(b)	providing access would prejudice measures for the protection of the health or safety of the public; or
(c)	providing access would unreasonably interfere with the privacy of another individual; or
(d)	the request for access is frivolous or vexatious; or
(e)	the information relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings between the organisation and the individual and the information would not be accessible by the process of discovery or subpoena in those proceedings; or

(g)	providing access would be unlawful; or
(h)	denying access is required or authorised by law; or

(i)	the security or defence of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory of the Commonwealth; or
(ii)	the maintenance of law and order in the Territory.
6.2	However, where providing access under IPP 6.1 would reveal evaluative information generated within a public sector organisation in connection with a commercially sensitive decision-making process, the organisation may give the individual an explanation for the commercially sensitive decision rather than access to the decision.
6.3	If a public sector organisation holds personal information about an individual and the individual establishes that the information is not accurate, complete or up to date, the organisation must take reasonable steps to correct the information so that it is accurate, complete and up to date.
6.4	If:
(a)	an individual and a public sector organisation disagree about whether personal information about the individual held by the organisation is accurate, complete or up to date; and
(b)	the individual requests the organisation to associate with the information a statement to the effect that, in the individual's opinion, the information is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date;
the organisation must take reasonable steps to comply with that request.

(c)	it is an outsourcing organisation adopting the unique identifier created by a contract service provider in the performance of its obligations to the outsourcing organisation under a service contract.
7.3	A public sector organisation must not use or disclose a unique identifier assigned to an individual by another public sector organisation unless:
(a)	the use or disclosure is necessary for the organisation to fulfil its obligations to that other organisation; or

(c)	it has obtained the consent of the individual to the use or disclosure.

10.1	A public sector organisation must not collect sensitive information about an individual unless:
(a)	the individual consents to the collection; or
(b)	the organisation is authorised or required by law to collect the information; or
