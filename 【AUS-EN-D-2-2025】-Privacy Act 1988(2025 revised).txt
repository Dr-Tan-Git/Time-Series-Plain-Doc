7A  Acts of certain agencies treated as acts of organisation
	(1)	This Act applies, with the prescribed modifications (if any), in relation to an act or practice described in subsection (2) or (3) as if:
	(a)	the act or practice were an act done, or practice engaged in, by an organisation; and
	(b)	the agency mentioned in that subsection were the organisation.

Individuals in non-business capacity

Organisation acting under Commonwealth contract
	(2)	An act done, or practice engaged in, by an organisation is exempt for the purposes of paragraph 7(1)(ee) if:

	(c)	the act is done, or the practice is engaged in, otherwise than for the purposes of meeting (directly or indirectly) an obligation under a Commonwealth contract for which the organisation is the contracted service provider.
Note:	This puts the organisation in the same position as a small business operator as far as its activities that are not for the purposes of a Commonwealth contract are concerned, so the organisation need not comply with the Australian Privacy Principles, or a registered APP code that binds the organisation, in relation to those activities.
Employee records
	(3)	An act done, or practice engaged in, by an organisation that is or was an employer of an individual, is exempt for the purposes of paragraph 7(1)(ee) if the act or practice is directly related to:

7C  Political acts and practices are exempt
Members of a Parliament etc.
	(1)	An act done, or practice engaged in, by an organisation (the political representative) consisting of a member of a Parliament, or a councillor (however described) of a local government authority, is exempt for the purposes of paragraph 7(1)(ee) if the act is done, or the practice is engaged in, for any purpose in connection with:
	(a)	an election under an electoral law; or
	(b)	a referendum under a law of the Commonwealth or a law of a State or Territory; or
	(c)	the participation by the political representative in another aspect of the political process.

	(a)	for the purposes of meeting an obligation under a contract between the subcontractor and a contractor described in subsection (2); and
	(b)	for a purpose described in paragraph (2)(b).
Volunteers for registered political parties
	(4)	An act done voluntarily, or practice engaged in voluntarily, by an organisation for or on behalf of a registered political party and with the authority of the party is exempt for the purposes of paragraph 7(1)(ee) if the act is done or the practice is engaged in for any purpose in connection with one or more of the following:
	(a)	an election under an electoral law;
	(b)	a referendum under a law of the Commonwealth or a law of a State or Territory;
	(c)	the participation in another aspect of the political process by the registered political party;
	(d)	facilitating acts or practices of the registered political party for a purpose mentioned in paragraph (a), (b) or (c).

Parliament means:
	(a)	the Parliament of the Commonwealth; or
	(b)	a State Parliament; or

Note:	To avoid doubt, this section does not make exempt for the purposes of paragraph 7(1)(ee) an act or practice of the political representative, contractor, subcontractor or volunteer for a registered political party involving the use or disclosure (by way of sale or otherwise) of personal information in a way not covered by subsection (1), (2), (3) or (4) (as appropriate). The rest of this Act operates normally in relation to that act or practice.

Part III-Information privacy
Division 1-Interferences with privacy
13  Interferences with privacy
APP entities
	(1)	An act or practice of an APP entity is an interference with the privacy of an individual if:
	(a)	the act or practice breaches an Australian Privacy Principle in relation to personal information about the individual; or
	(b)	the act or practice breaches a registered APP code that binds the entity in relation to personal information about the individual.
Credit reporting
	(2)	An act or practice of an entity is an interference with the privacy of an individual if:
	(a)	the act or practice breaches a provision of Part IIIA in relation to personal information about the individual; or
	(b)	the act or practice breaches the registered CR code in relation to personal information about the individual and the code binds the entity.
Contracted service providers
	(3)	An act or practice of an organisation is an interference with the privacy of an individual if:
	(a)	the act or practice relates to personal information about the individual; and
	(b)	the organisation is a contracted service provider for a Commonwealth contract (whether or not the organisation is a party to the contract); and
	(c)	the act or practice does not breach:
	(i)	an Australian Privacy Principle; or
	(ii)	a registered APP code that binds the organisation;
		in relation to the personal information because of a provision of the contract that is inconsistent with the principle or code; and
	(d)	the act is done, or the practice is engaged in, in a manner contrary to, or inconsistent with, that provision.
Note:	See subsections 6A(2) and 6B(2) for when an act or practice does not breach an Australian Privacy Principle or a registered APP code.
Tax file numbers
	(4)	An act or practice is an interference with the privacy of an individual if:
	(a)	it is an act or practice of a file number recipient and the act or practice breaches a rule issued under section 17 in relation to tax file number information that relates to the individual; or
	(b)	the act or practice involves an unauthorised requirement or request for disclosure of the tax file number of the individual.
Notification of eligible data breaches etc.
	(4A)	If an entity (within the meaning of Part IIIC) contravenes subsection 26WH(2), 26WK(2), 26WL(3) or 26WR(10), the contravention is taken to be an act that is an interference with the privacy of an individual.
Other interferences with privacy
	(5)	An act or practice is an interference with the privacy of an individual if the act or practice:
	(a)	constitutes a breach of Part 2 of the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990 or the rules issued under section 12 of that Act; or
	(b)	constitutes a breach of the rules issued under section 135AA of the National Health Act 1953.
Note:	Other Acts may provide that an act or practice is an interference with the privacy of an individual. For example, see the Healthcare Identifiers Act 2010, the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 and the Personal Property Securities Act 2009.
13B  Related bodies corporate
Acts or practices that are not interferences with privacy
	(1)	Despite subsection 13(1), each of the following acts or practices of an organisation that is a body corporate is not an interference with the privacy of an individual:
	(a)	the collection of personal information (other than sensitive information) about the individual by the body corporate from a related body corporate;
	(b)	the disclosure of personal information (other than sensitive information) about the individual by the body corporate to a related body corporate.
Note:	Subsection (1) lets related bodies corporate share personal information. However, in using or holding the information, they must comply with the Australian Privacy Principles and a registered APP code that binds them. For example, there is an interference with privacy if:
(a)	a body corporate uses personal information it has collected from a related body corporate; and
(b)	the use breaches Australian Privacy Principle 6 (noting that the collecting body's primary purpose of collection will be taken to be the same as that of the related body).
	(1A)	However, paragraph (1)(a) does not apply to the collection by a body corporate of personal information (other than sensitive information) from:
	(a)	a related body corporate that is not an organisation; or
	(b)	a related body corporate whose disclosure of the information to the body corporate is an exempt act or exempt practice for the purposes of paragraph 7(1)(ee); or
	(c)	a related body corporate whose disclosure of the information to the body corporate is not an interference with privacy because of section 13D.
Note:	The effect of subsection (1A) is that a body corporate's failure to comply with the Australian Privacy Principles, or a registered APP code that binds the body, in collecting personal information about an individual from a related body corporate covered by that subsection is an interference with the privacy of the individual.
Relationship with subsection 13(3)
	(2)	Subsection (1) does not prevent an act or practice of an organisation from being an interference with the privacy of an individual under subsection 13(3).
13C  Change in partnership because of change in partners
Acts or practices that are not interferences with privacy
	(1)	If:
	(a)	an organisation (the new partnership) that is a partnership forms at the same time as, or immediately after, the dissolution of another partnership (the old partnership); and
	(b)	at least one person who was a partner in the old partnership is a partner in the new partnership; and
	(c)	the new partnership carries on a business that is the same as, or similar to, a business carried on by the old partnership; and
	(d)	the new partnership holds, immediately after its formation, personal information about an individual that the old partnership held immediately before its dissolution;
neither the disclosure (if any) by the old partnership, nor the collection (if any) by the new partnership, of the information that was necessary for the new partnership to hold the information immediately after its formation constitutes an interference with the privacy of the individual.
Note:	Subsection (1) lets personal information be passed on from an old to a new partnership. However, in using or holding the information, they must comply with the Australian Privacy Principles and a registered APP code that binds them. For example, the new partnership's use of personal information collected from the old partnership may constitute an interference with privacy if it breaches Australian Privacy Principle 6.
Effect of subsection (1)
	(2)	Subsection (1) has effect despite subsections 13(1) and (3).
13D  Overseas act required by foreign law
Acts or practices that are not interferences with privacy
	(1)	An act or practice of an organisation done or engaged in outside Australia and an external Territory is not an interference with the privacy of an individual if the act or practice is required by an applicable law of a foreign country.
Effect of subsection (1)
	(2)	Subsection (1) has effect despite subsections 13(1) and (3).
13E  Effect of sections 13B, 13C and 13D
		Sections 13B, 13C and 13D do not prevent an act or practice of an organisation from being an interference with the privacy of an individual under subsection 13(2), (4) or (5).
13F  Act or practice not covered by section 13 is not an interference with privacy
		An act or practice that is not covered by section 13 is not an interference with the privacy of an individual.
13G  Civil penalty provision for serious interference with privacy of an individual
Civil penalty provision
	(1)	An entity contravenes this subsection if:
	(a)	the entity does an act, or engages in a practice, that is an interference with the privacy of an individual; and
	(b)	the interference with privacy is serious.
Note:	The court may determine that an entity has contravened section 13H if the court is satisfied of paragraph (a) but not paragraph (b) (see section 13J).
	(1A)	Subsection (1) is a civil penalty provision.
Note:	Section 80U deals with civil penalty provisions in this Act.
Factors that may be taken into account in determining if interference with privacy is serious
	(1B)	In determining whether an interference with privacy is serious, a court may have regard to any of the following matters:
	(a)	the particular kind or kinds of information involved in the interference with privacy;
	(b)	the sensitivity of the personal information of the individual;
	(c)	the consequences, or potential consequences, of the interference with privacy for the individual;
	(d)	the number of individuals affected by the interference with privacy;
	(e)	whether the individual affected by the interference with privacy is a child or person experiencing vulnerability;
	(f)	whether the act was done, or the practice engaged in, repeatedly or continuously;
	(g)	whether the contravening entity failed to take steps to implement practices, procedures and systems to comply with their obligations in relation to privacy in a way that contributed to the interference with privacy;
	(h)	any other relevant matter.
Maximum pecuniary penalty
	(2)	The amount of the penalty for a contravention of subsection (1) by a person other than a body corporate is an amount not more than $2,500,000.
	(3)	The amount of the penalty for a contravention of subsection (1) by a body corporate is an amount not more than the greatest of the following:
	(a)	$50,000,000;
	(b)	if the court can determine the value of the benefit that the body corporate, and any related body corporate, have obtained directly or indirectly and that is reasonably attributable to the conduct constituting the contravention-3 times the value of that benefit;
	(c)	if the court cannot determine the value of that benefit-30% of the adjusted turnover of the body corporate during the breach turnover period for the contravention.

	(a)	establish a cause of action for serious invasions of privacy; and

	(c)	recognise that there is a public interest in protecting privacy; and
	(d)	recognise that the public interest in protecting privacy is balanced with other public interests; and
	(e)	implement Australia's international obligations in relation to privacy.
2  Simplified outline of this Schedule
This Schedule establishes a cause of action in tort for serious invasions of privacy.
An individual has a cause of action against another person if, among other things, the other person invaded the individual's privacy by intruding upon their seclusion or misusing information relating to them.
It is a defence to the cause of action if the other person acted with lawful authority or in certain circumstances involving consent, necessity or the defence of persons or property. If the invasion of privacy involved the publication of information, the other person may also have access to certain defences that would ordinarily arise in the context of defamation proceedings.
Exemptions apply in relation to intelligence agencies and law enforcement bodies, persons disclosing information to such agencies or bodies, persons using information disclosed by such agencies or bodies, and persons under 18 years of age. Journalists and certain other persons are also exempt in certain circumstances.
The court may, during the proceedings, grant an injunction restraining the other person from invading the individual's privacy. The court may also summarily dismiss the proceedings in certain circumstances.
The court may grant remedies including damages.
There are time limits on when proceedings under this Schedule may be commenced.
This Schedule is intended to be read and construed separately from the rest of this Act.

	(2)	The court may make the determination on application of a party to the proceedings or on its own motion.
	(3)	If a party to the proceedings applies for a determination under this clause before the trial for the proceedings commences, the court is to make the determination as soon as practicable, and before the trial commences, unless satisfied that there are special circumstances justifying the postponement of the determination to a later stage of the proceedings (including during the trial).
	(4)	This clause does not limit any powers that the court has apart from this clause.
9  Injunctions
	(1)	The court may, at any stage of the proceedings, grant an injunction restraining the defendant from invading the plaintiff's privacy.

12  Other remedies
	(1)	The court may grant such remedies, in addition to or instead of damages awarded in accordance with clause 11, as the court thinks most appropriate in the circumstances.

13  The effect of an apology on liability
		For the purposes of this Schedule, an apology made by or on behalf of the defendant in connection with the invasion of privacy:
	(a)	does not constitute an express or implied admission of fault or liability by the defendant in connection with the invasion of privacy; and
	(b)	is not relevant to the determination of fault or liability in connection with the invasion of privacy.
Note:	The court may consider whether the defendant apologised to the plaintiff in determining the amount of damages (if any) to award to the plaintiff (see paragraph 11(6)(a)).
14  When proceedings must be commenced
	(1)	The plaintiff must commence proceedings under this Schedule:
