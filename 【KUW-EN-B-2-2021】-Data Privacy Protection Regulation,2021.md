COMMUNICATION & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY REGULATORY AUTHORITY

# Data Privacy Protection Regulation

Version: V1.8

# Preface

Demand for information technology services is growing, by both the public and private sectors, as service providers in the State of Kuwait offer such services using traditional and advanced technologies such as Cloud Computing solutions, Block Chain and Internet of Things "IoT", in addition to other technologies. This is due to the advantages associated with such services, which depend on the resources of operational infrastructure, software and other elements of information technology that are provided and operated by Communications and Information Technology Service Providers, that include storage, transfer, or process the user's data. Therefore, CITRA realizes the need for Communications and Information Technology Service Providers to commit to the protection of such data and basic rights and freedoms in respect of transferring the privacy of aggregated personal data. This in turn requires CITRA to issue a set of regulatory tools, conditions, and guidance related to the practice of service providers and all associated provisions and benefits, and obligations to support this vision.

The Communications and Information Technology Regulatory Authority ("CITRA") aspires to develop a robust industry that relies on the best communication and IT services, making it available to government bodies, businesses and individuals within the State of Kuwait. This would enhance government, commercial and industrial activities and contribute to attracting investors interested in this field, and strengthen competitiveness foundations to realize the State of Kuwait's vision in transforming it into a financial and commercial center (New Kuwait 2035).
