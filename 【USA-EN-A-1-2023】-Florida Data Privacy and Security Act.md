501.705 Consumer rights.-

(1) A consumer is entitled to exercise the consumer rights authorized by this section at any time by submitting a request to a controller which specifies the consumer rights that the

consumer wishes to exercise. With respect to the processing of personal data belonging to a known child, a parent or legal guardian of the child may exercise these rights on behalf of the child.

(2) A controller shall comply with an authenticated consumer request to exercise any of the following rights:

(a) To confirm whether a controller is processing the consumer's personal data and to access the personal data.

(b) To correct inaccuracies in the consumer's personal data, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the purposes of the processing of the consumer's personal data.

(c) To delete any or all personal data provided by or obtained about the consumer.

(2) A controller shall respond to the consumer request without undue delay, which may not be later than 45 days after the date of receipt of the request. The controller may extend the response period once by an additional 15 days when reasonably necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the consumer's requests, so long as the controller informs the consumer of the extension within the initial 45-day response period, together with the reason for the extension.

(3) If a controller cannot take action regarding the consumer's request, the controller must inform the consumer without undue delay, which may not be later than 45 days after the date of receipt of the request, of the justification for the inability to take action on the request and provide instructions on how to appeal the decision in accordance with s. 501.707. A controller is not required to comply with a consumer request

submitted under s. 501.705 if the controller cannot authenticate the request. However, the controller must make a reasonable effort to request that the consumer provide additional information reasonably necessary to authenticate the consumer and the consumer's request. If a controller maintains a self-service mechanism to allow a consumer to correct certain personal data, the controller may deny the consumer's request and require the consumer to correct his or her own personal data through such mechanism.

(4) A controller must provide the consumer with notice within 60 days after the request is received that the controller has complied with the consumer's request as required in this section.

If a request from a consumer is manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repetitive, the controller may charge the consumer a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying with the request or may decline to act on the request. The controller bears the burden of demonstrating for purposes of this subsection that a request is manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repetitive.  
(6) A controller who has obtained personal data about a consumer from a source other than the consumer is considered in compliance with a consumer's request to delete that personal data pursuant to s. 501.705(2) (c), by doing any of the following:  
(a) Deleting the personal data, retaining a record of the deletion request and the minimum data necessary for the purpose

of ensuring that the consumer's personal data remains deleted from the business's records, and not using the retained data for any other purpose under this part.

(b) Opting the consumer out of the processing of that personal data for any purpose other than a purpose exempt under this part.

(4) A controller or processor that processes personal data pursuant to ss. 501.716, 501.717, and 501.718 bears the burden of demonstrating that the processing of the personal data qualifies for the exemption and complies with the requirements of this section.

Section 23. Section 501.72, Florida Statutes, is created to read:

501.72 Enforcement and implementation by the Department of Legal Affairs.-

(1) A violation of this part is an unfair and deceptive trade practice actionable under part II of this chapter solely by the Department of Legal Affairs. If the department has reason to believe that a person is in violation of this section, the department may, as the enforcing authority, bring an action against such person for an unfair or deceptive act or practice. For the purpose of bringing an action pursuant to this section, ss. 501.211 and 501.212 do not apply. In addition to other remedies under part II of this chapter, the department may collect a civil penalty of up to $50,000 per violation. Civil penalties may be tripled for any of the following violations:

(a) A violation involving a Florida consumer who is a known child. A controller that willfully disregards the consumer's age is deemed to have actual knowledge of the consumer's age.

(b) Failure to delete or correct the consumer's personal data pursuant to this section after receiving an authenticated consumer request or directions from a controller to delete or correct such personal data, unless an exception to the requirements to delete or correct such personal data under this section applies.

(c) Continuing to sell or share the consumer's personal data after the consumer chooses to opt out under this part.  
(2) After the department has notified a person in writing of an alleged violation, the department may grant a 45-day period to cure the alleged violation and issue a letter of guidance. The 45-day cure period does not apply to an alleged violation of paragraph (1) (a). The department may consider the number and frequency of violations, the substantial likelihood of injury to the public, and the safety of persons or property in determining whether to grant 45 calendar days to cure and the issuance of a letter of guidance. If the alleged violation is cured to the satisfaction of the department and proof of such cure is provided to the department, the department may not bring an action for the alleged violation but in its discretion may issue a letter of guidance that indicates that the person will not be offered a 45-day cure period for any future violations. If the person fails to cure the alleged violation within 45 calendar days, the department may bring an action against such person for the alleged violation.  
(3) Any action brought by the department may be brought only on behalf of a Florida consumer.  
(4) By February 1 of each year, the department shall make a report publicly available on the department's website describing

any actions taken by the department to enforce this section. The report must include statistics and relevant information detailing all of the following:

(a) The number of complaints received and the categories or types of violations alleged by the complainant.  
(b) The number and type of enforcement actions taken and the outcomes of such actions, including the amount of penalties issued and collected.  
(c) The number of complaints resolved without the need for litigation.  
(d) For the report due February 1, 2024, the status of the development and implementation of rules to implement this section.  
(5) The department shall adopt rules to implement this section, including standards for authenticated consumer requests, enforcement, data security, and authorized persons who may act on a consumer's behalf.  
(6) The department may collaborate and cooperate with other enforcement authorities of the Federal Government or other state governments concerning consumer data privacy issues and consumer data privacy investigations if such enforcement authorities have restrictions governing confidentiality at least as stringent as the restrictions provided in this section.  
(7) Liability for a tort, contract claim, or consumer protection claim unrelated to an action brought under this section does not arise solely from the failure of a person to comply with this part.  
(8) This part does not establish a private cause of action.  
(9) The department may employ or use the legal services of

outside counsel and the investigative services of outside personnel to fulfill the obligations of this section.

(10) For purposes of bringing an action pursuant to this section, any person who meets the definition of controller as defined in this part who collects, shares, or sells the personal data of Florida consumers is considered to be engaged in both substantial and not isolated activities within this state and operating, conducting, engaging in, or carrying on a business, and doing business in this state, and is, therefore, subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state.

Section 24. Section 501.721, Florida Statutes, is created to read:

501.721 Preemption.-This part is a matter of statewide concern and supersedes all rules, regulations, codes, ordinances, and other laws adopted by a city, county, city and county, municipality, or local agency regarding the collection, processing, sharing, or sale of consumer personal data by a controller or processor. The regulation of the collection, processing, sharing, or sale of consumer personal data by a controller or processor is preempted to the state.
