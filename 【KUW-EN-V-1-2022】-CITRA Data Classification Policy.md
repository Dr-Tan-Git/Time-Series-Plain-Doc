# 2. Introduction

This policy outlines a methodology for data classification for the public and private sectors. Which, when followed, leads to defining the acceptable level of security protection, ensuring adherence to acceptable best practices, and determining the means for data handling, transmission, and processing. Whereas the failure to follow any approach to classify data and provide the necessary protection for each category would expose this data to various electronic risks such as data leakage, wrong handling and sharing, or penetration.

# 2.1 Data Classification Objectives

2.1.1 Objective: classifying data into separate categories helps in better decisions making, regarding data access and processing in line with the data classification levels mentioned in this policy, which contributes in helping the government or private entities to take all necessary measures to enhance the security and protection of their data and the personal data they have of the individuals, in a consistent manner with the requirements and institutions plans, laws and regulations applicable in the State of Kuwait.

2.1.2 Scope: the policy scope includes data that is processed, stored, modified, or transferred by computer or smart devices, i.e., digital data (structured or unstructured), which government and private entities create, collect, and maintain as part of their official business functions and use or share for the purpose of providing public services. Examples of structured data include individuals' data (such as personal or company data), non-customer data (such as environmental data), and organizational data (such as human resources, finance, and data related to assets and purchases). Unstructured data includes text-based data (but not limited to word processor documents, presentation slides, photos, video clips, and audio recordings), data of printed documents fall out of the scope of this policy. As for the access of printing or copying digital data, they must be determined based on the sensitivity of the content and according to the level of classification in which they fall under.

# 3. Data Classification Policy

# 3.1 Policy Items

3.1.1 The data owner shall classify their data into at least four levels. Entities of a security or military nature of the country are excluded from adherence to the classification levels specified in this policy, and they have the option to classify their data as they see appropriate. If the data owner has a different classification system, mapping must be made to the classified data with the classification system mentioned in this policy.  
3.1.2 The owner of the data is free to choose their data protection methods according to their data classification, retention, collection, and processing schemes. The data owner must

also ensure that necessary protection is provided to their data storing scheme depending on its classification, especially Tier 3 and Tier 4 data, to protect them from hacking.

3.1.3 The data owner is required to create and maintain a data catalog which should include the metadata information and standards for its data in a unified format. This catalog should also be updated periodically.  
3.1.4 The data owner must encrypt all classified data that falls under Tier 3 and Tier 4 during transmission from one government entity to another, or when transmitted between different physical geographical locations of government entities; this applies to the private sector as well.  
3.1.5 The data owner must ensure that all data classified according to the third and fourth levels are transferred or removed from data centers and servers before the disposition of the equipment of data centers and servers hosting the data.  
3.1.6 The data classification levels mentioned in this policy have been developed based on the best regional and global practices, and the data owner is free to use other classification levels if they are best suitable with the type of data they have, in accordance with international best practices and standards such as NIST 800-53, NIST SP 800-60, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, and HIPAA to ensure the validity and quality of classification.

# 3.2 What to consider before starting the data classification process

3.2.1 Data gathering, auditing, and analyzing processes. Incomplete, vague, or ambiguous data should be excluded or modified.  
3.2.2 Considering the accuracy in sorting and placing data in the classification levels in accordance with this policy, to determine and evaluate the risks on each level to ensure the safety and protection of the data.  
3.2.3 Forming a data classification team headed by the senior management or their representatives, with the membership of the Director of Information Security, the Director of the Information Technology Department, in addition to the directors of the various departments that own or store the data of the entity, whether this data is personal and belong to subscribers or data belonging to the entity itself. As this team is responsible of classifying the data in the entity and labeling it according to its sensitivity level and in line with what is stated in this policy.  
3.2.4 In order to ensure the full implementation of data classification and to support the unification of procedures between the various entities, the authorities must do what is necessary towards developing a road map and an action plan that explains how to implement the process of classifying data according to the four basic levels described in this policy, provided that the data classifications is to be reviewed internally in an appropriate periodic and fixed manner.  
3.2.5 Determine and prioritize data sets, classify the data of high priority before other groups of lower levels of priority, where priority level is according to the importance of the data,

its sensitivity and business value. This depends on the current data management maturity level within the entity, the size of the entity's operations, and the extent of data importance to its functions.

3.2.6 Government and private sector entities shall be responsible for defining the roles and responsibilities of the of its workforce, to implement the data classification policy within its scope.  
3.2.7 The roles and responsibilities for managing and classifying the data are determined according to the discretion of each entity as it deems appropriate, as each entity differs from the others in terms of infrastructure and procedures for managing the data. The entity can decide to create new jobs to fulfill these roles or add responsibilities to the current roles.  
3.2.8 The sensitivity of the data should not be overemphasized.
