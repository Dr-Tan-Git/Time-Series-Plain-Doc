# Subtitle A—Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States

SEC. 1701. SHORT TITLE: FOREIGN INVESTMENT RISK REVIEW MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2018.

This subtitle may be cited as the "Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018".

SEC. 1702. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following findings:

(1) According to a February 2016 report by the International Trade Administration of the Department of Commerce, 12,000,000 United States workers, equivalent to 8.5 percent of the labor force, have jobs resulting from foreign investment, including 3,500,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector alone.

(2) In 2016, new foreign direct investment in United States manufacturing totaled $129,400,000,000.

(3) The Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Department of Commerce concluded that, in 2015—

(A) foreign-owned affiliates in the United States—

(i) contributed $894,500,000,000 in value added to the United States economy;

(ii) exported goods valued at $352,800,000,000, accounting for nearly a quarter of total exports of goods from the United States; and

(iii) undertook $56,700,000,000 in research and development; and

(B) the 7 countries investing the most in the United States, all of which are United States allies (the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, France, Canada, Switzerland, and the Netherlands) accounted for 72.1 percent of the value added by foreign-owned affiliates in the United States and more than 80 percent of research and development expenditures by such entities.

(4) According to the Government Accountability Office, from 2011 to 2016, the number of transactions reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (commonly referred to as "CFIUS") grew by 55 percent, while the staff of the Committees assigned to the reviews increased by 11 percent.  
(5) According to a February 2018 report of the Government Accountability Office on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (GAO-18-249): "Officials from Treasury and other member agencies are aware of pressures on their CFIUS staff given the current workload and have expressed concerns about possible workload increases." The Government Accountability Office concluded: "Without attaining an understanding of the staffing levels needed to address the current and future CFIUS workload, particularly if legislative changes to CFIUS's authorities further expand its workload, CFIUS may be limited in its ability to fulfill its objectives and address threats to the national security of the United States."  
(6) On March 30, 1954, Dwight David Eisenhower—five-star general, Supreme Allied Commander, and 34th President of the United States—in his "Special Message to the Congress on Foreign Economic Policy", counseled: "Great mutual advantages to buyer and seller, to producer and consumer, to investor and to the community where investment is made, accrue from high levels of trade and investment." President Eisenhower continued: "The internal strength of the American economy has evolved from such a system of mutual advantage. In the press of other problems and in the haste to meet emergencies, this nation—and many other nations of the free world—have all too often lost sight of this central fact." President Eisenhower concluded: "If we fail in our trade policy, we may fail in all. Our domestic employment, our standard of living, our security, and the solidarity of the free world—all are involved." (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Congress that—  
(1) foreign investment provides substantial economic benefits to the United States, including the promotion of economic growth, productivity, competitiveness, and job creation, thereby enhancing national security;  
(2) maintaining the commitment of the United States to an open investment policy encourages other countries to reciprocate and helps open new foreign markets for United States businesses;  
(3) it should continue to be the policy of the United States to enthusiastically welcome and support foreign investment, consistent with the protection of national security;  
(4) at the same time, the national security landscape has shifted in recent years, and so has the nature of the investments that pose the greatest potential risk to national security, which warrants an appropriate modernization of the processes and

authorities of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and of the United States export control system;

(5) the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States plays a critical role in protecting the national security of the United States, and, therefore, it is essential that the member agencies of the Committee are adequately resourced and able to hire appropriately qualified individuals in a timely manner, and that those individuals' security clearances are processed as a high priority;

(6) the President should conduct a more robust international outreach effort to urge and help allies and partners of the United States to establish processes that are similar to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to screen foreign investments for national security risks and to facilitate coordination;

(7) the President should lead a collaborative effort with allies and partners of the United States to strengthen the multilateral export control regime;

(8) any penalties imposed by the United States Government with respect to an individual or entity pursuant to a determination that the individual or entity has violated sanctions imposed by the United States or the export control laws of the United States should not be reversed for reasons unrelated to the national security of the United States; and

(9) the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States should continue to review transactions for the purpose of protecting national security and should not consider issues of national interest absent a national security nexus.

(c) SENSE OF CONGRESS ON CONSIDERATION OF COVERED TRANSACTIONS.—It is the sense of Congress that, when considering national security risks, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States may consider—

(1) whether a covered transaction involves a country of special concern that has a demonstrated or declared strategic goal of acquiring a type of critical technology or critical infrastructure that would affect United States leadership in areas related to national security;  
(2) the potential national security-related effects of the cumulative control of, or pattern of recent transactions involving, any one type of critical infrastructure, energy asset, critical material, or critical technology by a foreign government or foreign person;  
(3) whether any foreign person engaging in a covered transaction with a United States business has a history of complying with United States laws and regulations;  
(4) the control of United States industries and commercial activity by foreign persons as it affects the capability and capacity of the United States to meet the requirements of national security, including the availability of human resources, products, technology, materials, and other supplies and services, and in considering "the availability of human resources", should construe that term to include potential losses of such availability resulting from reductions in the employment of United States persons whose knowledge or skills are critical to national security, including the continued production in the United States of items that are likely to be acquired by the

Department of Defense or other Federal departments or agencies for the advancement of the national security of the United States;

(5) the extent to which a covered transaction is likely to expose, either directly or indirectly, personally identifiable information, genetic information, or other sensitive data of United States citizens to access by a foreign government or foreign person that may exploit that information in a manner that threatens national security; and

(6) whether a covered transaction is likely to have the effect of exacerbating or creating new cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the United States or is likely to result in a foreign government gaining a significant new capability to engage in malicious cyber-enabled activities against the United States, including such activities designed to affect the outcome of any election for Federal office.
