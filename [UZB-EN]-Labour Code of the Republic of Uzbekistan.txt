The Labor Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan (hereinafter, the Labor Code or LC) was adopted on December 21, 1995 and entered into force on April 30, 1996. It should be noted that the Republic of Uzbekistan was the first among the other post-Soviet republics to adopt this code. After 27 years, on October 28, 2022 the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan signed Law № ZRU-798 “On Approval of the Labor Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan” in this connection, since April 1, 2023 the Labor Code, will be effective in our Republic in new edition.

This memorandum focuses on the amendments that have been included in the new edition of the Labor Code.

New edition of the Labor Code consists of:

581 articles;
34 paragraphs; and
7 sections.
1.1 General provisions

Principles

The new edition of the LC approved the following principles of legal regulation of individual labor and directly related social relations:

Equality of labor rights, prohibition of discrimination in the sphere of labor and occupation;
Freedom of labor and prohibition of forced labor;
Social partnership in the area of labor;
Guaranteed security of labor rights and performance of labor duties;
Inadmissibility of worsening the legal status of an employee.
According to the second principle, it is forbidden to conclude an employment contract on coercion of the employer and the employee. In addition to this, it is not allowed to conclude contracts of civil-legal nature that actually regulate individual labor relations between the employee and the employer.  

Code enforcement

Article 11 of the Labor Code specifies the persons to whom this code applies and does not apply, thus, the labor law applies to:

the individual employment relationship between the employee and the employer;
public relations directly related to individual labor relations.
According to this article, the labor law does not apply to:

Members of the armed forces who are on fixed-term military service;
Members of supervisory boards of organizations;
Members of audit commissions (auditors) who are not employees of the organization;
Persons performing work (rendering services) who are not employees of the organization; and
Other persons, if established by law.
Other legislation

Also in the LC, the following treaties and agreements, which are categorized as other legal acts on labor, are designated:

Collective agreements;
Collective agreements;
Local acts adopted by the employer by agreement with the trade union committee; and
Local acts, including individual legal acts adopted by the employer alone within the limits of his authority.
Social partnership

The new version of the Labor Code provides for the following newly introduced concept as social partnership. It is worth noting that in the old version of the LC this concept was mentioned only once, but was not disclosed more broadly. According to Article 6 of the Labor Code, social partnership means interaction of employees, represented by their representatives, employers and their representatives, as well as government agencies aimed at ensuring coordination of interests of employees and employers and the state in the regulation of social and labor relations. Based on this principle, the labor legislation:

Creates the necessary conditions for the implementation of bilateral and trilateral cooperation in the field of labor. Bilateral cooperation, i.e. the agreement is concluded between the employee, their representatives and employers and their representatives, while the tripartite agreement is concluded between the representatives of employees, employers and the executive authorities;
Guarantees the right of workers and employers to unite to ensure representation and protection of their interests;
Guarantees the right of employee and employer representatives to conduct collective bargaining, conclude collective agreements and collective bargaining agreements;
Determines what local acts may be adopted by the employer in coordination with the elected body of the primary trade union organization, or other representative body of employees;
Provides for the participation of representatives of employees and employers in resolving labor disputes.
Social partnership in the labor sphere is carried out on 4 levels.

The primary level
Territorial level;
Industry level; and
Republican level.
Social partnership at the primary level is bilateral in nature. The parties at this level are the labor collective and the employer.

Territorial level has both bilateral and trilateral character. The parties to the bilateral social partnership are considered to be the respective associations of workers and employers. The local executive authorities and other interested state bodies participate in tripartite social partnership at the branch level on the proposal of territorial associations of workers and employers.

The industry level, like the territorial level, is bilateral and trilateral. The parties to the bilateral social partnership are the respective associations of workers and employers. At the proposal of branch associations of workers and employers, public administration bodies of the respective branch participate as parties to the tripartite social partnership. In cases where the public administration bodies of the relevant branch act as employers, the Ministry of Employment and Labor Relations of the Republic of Uzbekistan participates in the tripartite social partnership at this level.

The republican level in social partnership has tripartite nature. The parties at this level are the associations of workers and employers and the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan, the ministries, state committees and departments concerned.

We would like to emphasize that on September 25, 2014 in the Republic of Uzbekistan, the Law № ZRU-376 “On social partnership” was adopted, which regulated relations in the field of social partnership before the introduction of this concept into the Labor Code. By following the link, you can read about this law, too.

Socially vulnerable persons

Article 96 of the new edition of the Labor Code, establishes another innovation, the category of socially vulnerable persons. These include:

Single parents (a person replacing the parents) with children under the age of fourteen, children with disabilities, as well as parents (persons in loco parentis) with large families;
Young people who have acquired a profession upon graduation from general secondary and specialized secondary educational establishments, vocational schools, vocational colleges and technical colleges;
Graduates of “Mekhribonlik” homes, as well as graduates of higher graduates of higher educational organizations, who studied under state grants;
Persons discharged from fixed-term military service from the troops of the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the National Guard;
Persons with disabilities;
Persons of pre-retirement age (two years before the statutory retirement age);
Persons released from penal institutions or persons against whom a court decision has been made to impose compulsory measures of medical nature;
Victims of human trafficking.
The state provides additional guarantees in the field of employment, the above persons, by creating additional jobs, specialized organizations, retraining programs, and professional development, establishing a minimum number of jobs, the above categories of persons.

Severance payment

The new edition of the Labor Code gives a broader definition of severance pay. According to Article 173, termination indemnity is a lump sum payment provided by the legislation, other legal acts on labor, and the labor contract to the employee at the termination of the labor contract on certain grounds, which is made to mitigate the consequences of the employee’s job loss.

Severance payment is paid with the termination of the employment contract:

At the initiative of the employer, except for the termination of the contract on the grounds of guilty actions (inaction) of the employee;
Due to circumstances beyond the control of the parties
With the conscription of the employee for military or alternative service;
With the reinstatement of the employee, who previously performed the job;
With the entry into legal force of the court decision on the liquidation of the organization;
With the return of a deputy of the Legislative Chamber, as well as a member of the Senate of the Oliy Majlis of the Republic of Uzbekistan, who worked in the Senate on a permanent basis, to his previous position in connection with the expiration of the term of office or the dissolution of the Legislative Chamber and the Senate of the Oliy Majlis of the Republic of Uzbekistan; and in cases;
Violation of the established rules of employment on the part of the employer; and
With the occurrence of circumstances which, in accordance with the law, prevent the continuation of labor relations (recognition of the employee completely incapacitated).
It is worth noting that if under the old Labor Code, the severance pay could not exceed the average monthly earnings, according to the new version of the LC; the severance payment depends on the length of service with the employer and cannot be less:

50% of the average monthly earnings – for employees with up to 3 years of service;
75% of the average monthly earnings – for employees with three to five years of service;
100% of average monthly earnings – for employees with work experience of 5 to 10 years;
150% of the average monthly earnings – for employees with 10 to 50 years of service;
200% of average monthly earnings – for employees with more than 50 years of service.
Mass release protection  

The new edition of the Labor Code protects employees from mass release. Moreover, it is worth emphasizing that Article 98 of the LC enshrines the criteria for mass releasing, they include:

Liquidation of an organization of any organizational and legal form (its separate subdivision) with twenty or more employees; and
Reduction of the number (staff) of employees with:
Fifty or more employees within thirty calendar days
Two hundred and more employees within sixty calendar days; and
Five hundred and more employees within ninety calendar days.
1.2 Special section

Based on Article 122 of the Labor Code, there are three stages of hiring:

Job orientation;
Reaching an agreement between the parties on the terms of the employment contract and its signing by the employee and the employer;
Issuance of the employment order by the employer and entering information about the employment into the employee’s work record book and interdepartmental hardware and software complex “Unified National Labor System”.
Subject matter of the employment contract

So, on the basis of Article 104 of the Labor Code now, the following conditions at the conclusion of the employment contract between the employee and the employer are mandatory:

Place of work – the employer (organization, its separate subdivision or individual) where the employee will work, as well as the location where he/she is to work;

Other conditions in cases stipulated by labor legislation and other legal acts on labor.
Failure to include in the employment contract any rights and (or) obligations of the employee and the employer established by the labor law cannot be considered as a refusal to exercise these rights or perform these obligations.
