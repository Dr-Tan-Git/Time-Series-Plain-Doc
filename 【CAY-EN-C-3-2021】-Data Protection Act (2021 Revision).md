# Fundamental rights of access to personal data

8. (1) A person is entitled to be informed by a data controller whether the personal data of which the person is the data subject are being processed by or on behalf of that data controller, and, if that is the case, to be given by that data controller a description of —

(a) the data subject's personal data;  
(b) the purposes for which they are being or are to be processed by or on behalf of that data controller;  
(c) the recipients or classes of recipients to whom the data are or may be disclosed by or on behalf of that data controller;  
(d) any countries or territories outside the Islands to which the data controller, whether directly or indirectly, transfers, intends to transfer or wishes to transfer the data;  
(e) general measures to be taken for the purpose of complying with the seventh data protection principle; and  
(f) such other information as the Ombudsman may require the data controller to provide.

(2) A data subject is entitled to communication in an intelligible form, by the relevant data controller, of —

(a) the data subject's personal data; and  
(b) any information available to the relevant data controller as to the source of those personal data.

(3) If the processing by automatic means of the data subject's personal data for the purpose of evaluating matters relating to the data subject, including the data subject's performance at work, creditworthiness, reliability or conduct, has constituted or is likely to constitute the sole basis for any decision significantly affecting the data subject, the data subject is entitled to be informed by the relevant data controller of the reasons for that decision.  
(4) A data controller shall not be obliged under subsection (1), (2) or (3) to supply any personal data unless the data controller has received —

(a) a request in writing; and  
(b) the fee that the data controller may require, such fee, being within the limits prescribed by regulations.

(5) If a data controller reasonably requires further information in order to be satisfied as to the identity of the data subject making the request or to locate the information that the data subject seeks, and has informed the data subject in writing of the requirement, the data controller is not obliged to comply with the request unless supplied with that information, during which period the time specified in subsection (6) shall automatically stand suspended.  
(6) A data controller shall comply with a request under this section within thirty days (or such other period as may be prescribed by regulations) of the date on which the data controller receives both the request and fee referred to in subsection (4), but where the data controller has requested further information under subsection (5), the period shall not resume until the information has been supplied.  
(7) If a data controller cannot comply with the request without disclosing personal data relating to another data subject who can be identified from that personal data, the data controller is not obliged to comply with the request unless —

(a) the other data subject has consented to the disclosure of the personal data to the person making the request; or  
(b) it is reasonable in all the circumstances to comply with the request without the consent of the other data subject.

(8) In subsection (7), the reference to personal data relating to another data subject includes a reference to personal data identifying that other data subject as the source of the personal data sought in the request.  
(9) Subsection (7) shall not be construed as excusing a data controller from communicating so much of the personal data sought in the request as can be communicated without disclosing the identity of the other data subject concerned, whether by the omission of names or other identifying particulars or otherwise.  
(10) In determining for the purposes of subsection (7)(b) whether it is reasonable in all the circumstances to comply with the request without the consent of the other data subject concerned, the data controller shall have regard to, in particular —

(a) any duty of confidentiality owed to the other data subject;  
(b) any steps taken by the data controller to seek the consent of the other data subject;  
(c) whether the other data subject is capable of giving consent; and  
(d) any express refusal of consent by the other data subject.

(11) If the Ombudsman is satisfied on the application of a data subject who has made a request under this section that a data controller has contravened this section in failing to comply with the request, the Ombudsman shall issue an enforcement order under section 45 ordering the data controller to comply with the request.  
(12) If personal data are being processed by or on behalf of a data controller who receives a request under this section from the data subject, the obligation to supply the personal data under this section includes an obligation to give the data subject a statement of the data subject's rights under this Act in such form, and to such extent, as may be prescribed by regulations.

# Treatment of requests under section 8

9. (1) The obligation imposed by section 8(2)(a) shall be complied with by supplying the data subject with a copy of the personal data in the format requested unless

(a) the supply of such a copy is not possible or would involve disproportionate effort; or  
(b) the data subject agrees otherwise.

(2) If any of the personal data referred to in section 8(2)(a) are expressed in terms that are not intelligible without explanation the copy shall be accompanied by an adequate explanation.  
(3) If a data controller has previously complied with a request under section 8 by the data subject referred to therein, the data controller is not obliged to comply with a subsequent identical or similar request under that section by the data subject unless the interval between compliance with the previous request and the making of the current request is reasonable.  
(4) In determining whether the interval referred to in subsection (3) is reasonable, regard shall be had to the nature of the personal data, the purpose for which the personal data are processed and the frequency with which the personal data are altered.  
(5) Section 8(3) shall not be regarded as requiring the provision of information as to the logic of any decision-making where the information constitutes a trade secret.  
(6) Personal data and other information supplied under section 8 shall be supplied by reference to the data in question at the time when the request for the personal data is received, except that account may be taken of any amendment or deletion made between that time and the time when the information is supplied, the amendment or deletion being such that would have been made regardless of the receipt of the request.

# Right to stop processing

10. (1) A data subject is entitled at any time, by notice in writing to a data controller, to require the data controller to cease processing, or not to begin processing, or to cease processing for a specified purpose or in a specified manner, the data subject's personal data.

(2) The data controller shall, as soon as practicable, but in any case within twenty-one days of receiving a notice under subsection (1), comply with that notice unless

(a) the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or the taking of steps at the request of the data subject with a view to entering into a contract;  
(b) the processing is necessary for compliance with any legal obligation to which the data controller is subject, other than an obligation imposed by contract;  
(c) the processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject; or  
(d) the processing is necessary in such other circumstances as may be prescribed by regulations,

and the data controller shall state to the data subject the reasons for the noncompliance with the notice.

(3) If, on the application of a data subject who has given notice under subsection (1), the Ombudsman is satisfied that the data controller in question has failed to comply with the notice, the Ombudsman may issue an enforcement order under section 45.  
(4) The failure by a data subject to exercise the right conferred by subsection (1) does not affect any other right conferred on the data subject by this Act.

# Right to stop processing for direct marketing

11. (1) In this section, "direct marketing" means the communication, by whatever means, of any advertising, marketing, promotional or similar material, that is directed to particular individuals.

(2) A data subject is entitled at any time, by notice in writing to a data controller, to require the data controller at the end of such period as is reasonable in the circumstances, to cease, or not to begin, processing for the purposes of direct marketing personal data relating to the data subject.  
(3) If, on the application of a data subject who has given notice under subsection (1), the Ombudsman is satisfied that the data controller in question has failed to comply with the notice, the Ombudsman may issue an enforcement order under section 45.

(4) The failure by a data subject to exercise the right conferred by subsection (2) does not affect any other right conferred on the data subject by this Act.

# Rights in relation to automated decision-making

12. (1) A data subject is entitled at any time, by notice in writing to a data controller, to require the data controller to ensure that no decision taken by or on behalf of the data controller that significantly affects the data subject is based solely on the processing by automatic means of the data subject's personal data for the purpose of evaluating the data subject's performance at work, creditworthiness, reliability, conduct or any other matters relating to the data subject.

(2) If no notice has been given under subsection (1) and a decision that significantly affects a data subject is based solely on processing specified in that subsection —

(a) the data controller shall as soon as reasonably practicable notify the data subject that the decision was taken on that basis; and  
(b) the data subject is entitled, within twenty-one days of receiving that notification from the data controller, by notice in writing, to require the data controller to reconsider the decision or to take a new decision otherwise than on that basis.

(3) The data controller shall, within twenty-one days of receiving a notice under subsection (2)(b), give the data subject a written notice specifying the steps that the data controller intends to take to comply with the notice.  
(4) A notice under subsection (1) does not have effect in relation to, and nothing in subsection (2) applies to, a decision —

(a) in respect of which one condition in each of subsections (5) and (6) is satisfied; or  
(b) that is made in such other circumstances as may be prescribed by regulations.

(5) The first condition is that the decision

(a) is taken in the course of steps taken

(i) for the purpose of considering whether to enter into a contract with the data subject;  
(ii) with a view to entering into such a contract; or  
(iii) in the course of performing such a contract; or

(b) is authorised or required by or under any enactment.

(6) The second condition is that

(a) the effect of the decision is to grant a request of the data subject; or  
(b) steps have been taken to safeguard the legitimate interests of the data subject including by allowing the data subject to make representations.

(7) If the Ombudsman is satisfied on the application of a data subject that a person taking a decision in respect of the data subject has failed to comply with a notice under subsection (1) or (2)(b), the Ombudsman may, among other things, issue an enforcement order directing the data controller to reconsider the decision where that decision is not based solely on the processing mentioned in subsection (1).

# Compensation for failure to comply

13. A person who suffers damage by reason of a contravention by a data controller of any requirement of this Act has a cause of action for compensation from the data controller for that damage.

# Rectification, blocking, erasure or destruction

14. (1) If the Ombudsman is satisfied on a complaint made under section 43 that personal data are inaccurate, the Ombudsman may order the data controller to rectify, block, erase or destroy —

(a) those data; and  
(b) any other personal data in respect of which the person is the data controller and that contain an expression of opinion that appears to the Ombudsman to be based on the inaccurate data.

(2) Subsection (1) applies whether or not the personal data accurately record information received or obtained by the data controller from the data subject or a third party, but, if the data accurately record such information, then the Ombudsman may instead of making an order under subsection (1) —

(a) make an order requiring the personal data to be supplemented by a statement of the facts relating to the matters dealt with by the data as the Ombudsman may approve;  
(b) make such order as the Ombudsman thinks fit to ensure the accuracy of the data, having regard to the purpose or purposes for which the data were obtained and further processed, with or without a further order requiring the data to be supplemented by a statement of the facts relating to the matters dealt with by the data as the Ombudsman may approve; or  
(c) make an order requiring the data controller to ensure that the data indicate that, in the data subject's view, the data are inaccurate.

(3) If the Ombudsman

(a) makes an order under subsection (1); or  
(b) is satisfied on a complaint made under section 43 that personal data that have been rectified, blocked, erased or destroyed were inaccurate,

the Ombudsman may, if it is considered reasonably practicable, order the data controller to notify third parties to whom the data have been disclosed of the rectification, blocking, erasure or destruction.

# PART 3 - RESTRICTED PROCESSING AND PERSONAL DATA BREACHES

# Preliminary determination by Ombudsman as to restricted processing

15. The Cabinet may, after consultation with the Ombudsman and such other persons that the Cabinet may consider appropriate, make regulations prescribing the types of processing that require the prior approval of the Ombudsman, being processing that is considered particularly likely to —

(a) cause substantial damage or substantial distress to data subjects; or  
(b) otherwise significantly prejudice the rights and freedoms of data subjects.

# Personal data breaches

16. (1) In the case of a personal data breach, the data controller shall, without undue delay, but no longer than five days after the data controller should, with the exercise of reasonable diligence, have been aware of that breach, notify the data subject of the data in question and the Ombudsman of that personal data breach, describing —

(a) the nature of the breach;  
(b) the consequences of the breach;  
(c) the measures proposed or taken by the data controller to address the breach; and  
(d) the measures recommended by the data controller to the data subject of the personal data in question to mitigate the possible adverse effects of the breach.

(2) A data controller who contravenes subsection (1) commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine of one hundred thousand dollars.

# Effect of this Part

17. Except as provided by this Part, the subject information provisions shall have effect notwithstanding any law prohibiting or restricting the disclosure, or authorising the withholding, of information.

# National security

18. (1) Personal data are exempt from any of the provisions of

(a) the data protection principles; and  
(b) Parts 2, 3 and 6,

if the exemption from any or all of the provisions is required for the purpose of safeguarding national security.

(2) The Governor may, for the purpose mentioned in subsection (1), issue a certificate with respect to any personal data exempting that data from all or any of the provisions referred to in that subsection and that certificate shall be sufficient evidence of that fact.  
(3) In the exercise of the discretion to issue a certificate under subsection (2), the Governor may consult with the National Security Council.  
(4) The certificate issued under subsection (2) shall identify the personal data to which it applies.  
(5) If in any consideration of a matter by the Ombudsman it is claimed by a data controller that a certificate under this section applies to any personal data, any party, that is, the Governor, the data controller or the data subject, may make an application to the Ombudsman contending that the certificate does not apply to the personal data with respect to which the complaint is made.  
(6) Notwithstanding subsection (5), unless the Ombudsman makes a determination under subsection (7), the certificate shall be conclusively presumed so to apply.  
(7) On an application under subsection (5), the Ombudsman may determine that the certificate does not apply to the personal data with respect to which the complaint is made.  
(8) A document purporting to be a certificate under this section and signed by the Governor shall be received in evidence and taken to be such a certificate unless the contrary is proved.

# Crime, government fees and duties

19. (1) Personal data processed for any of the following purposes —

(a) the prevention, detection or investigation of crime;  
(b) the apprehension or prosecution of persons who are suspected to have committed an offence anywhere; or  
(c) the assessment or collection of any fees or duty, or of any imposition of a similar nature, in the Islands,

are exempt from the first data protection principle (except to the extent to which it requires compliance with the conditions in Schedules 2 and 3), the non-disclosure provisions and section 8, to the extent to which the application of

those provisions to the data would be likely to prejudice any of the matters referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c).

(2) Personal data that

(a) are processed for the purpose of discharging functions under any Law; and  
(b) consist of information obtained for such a purpose from a person who had possession of it for any of the purposes referred to in subsections (1)(a) to (c),

are exempt from the subject information provisions to the same extent as personal data processed for any of the purposes referred to in subsections (1)(a) to (c).

# Health, education or social work

20. (1) The Cabinet may, by regulations, exempt from the subject information provisions, or modify those provisions in relation to, personal data consisting of information as to the physical or mental health or condition of the data subject.

(2) The Cabinet may, by regulations, exempt from the subject information provisions, or modify those provisions, in relation to personal data in respect of which the data controller is the proprietor, governor, governing body, director or manager of, or a principal or teacher at a school, and the personal data consist of information relating to persons who are or have been pupils at the school.  
(3) The Cabinet may, by regulations, exempt from the subject information provisions, (or modify those provisions in relation to,) personal data of such other descriptions as may be specified in the regulations, being information —

(a) processed by a public authority; and

# THE DATA PROTECTION PRINCIPLES AND THEIR INTERPRETATION

# PART 1 The Data Protection Principles

# First principle

1. Personal data shall be processed fairly. In addition, personal data may be processed only if

(a) in every case, at least one of the conditions set out in paragraphs 1 to 6 of Schedule 2 is met: and  
(b) in the case of sensitive personal data, at least one of the conditions in paragraphs 1 to 10 of Schedule 3 is also met.

# Second principle

2. Personal data shall be obtained only for one or more specified lawful purposes, and shall not be further processed in any manner incompatible with that purpose or those purposes.

# Third principle

3. Personal data shall be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose or purposes for which they are collected or processed.

# Fourth principle

4. Personal data shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.

# Fifth principle

5. Personal data processed for any purpose shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose.

# Sixth principle

6. Personal data shall be processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects under this Act.

# Seventh principle

7. Appropriate technical and organisational measures shall be taken against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data.

# Eighth principle

8. Personal data shall not be transferred to a country or territory unless that country or territory ensures an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data.

# PART 2 Interpretation of Data Protection Principles

# First principle: source

1. (1) In determining for the purposes of the first principle whether personal data are processed fairly, regard is to be had to

(a) the method by which they are obtained, including in particular whether any person from whom they are obtained is deceived or misled as to the purpose or purposes for which they are to be processed; and  
(b) whether the information contained in the personal data has previously been made public as a result of steps deliberately taken by the data subject.

(2) Subject to paragraph 2, for the purposes of the first principle, personal data are prima facie to be treated as obtained fairly if they consist of information obtained from a person who is required to supply it by or under an enactment or by a convention or other instrument imposing an international obligation on the Islands.

# First principle: specified information at relevant time

2. For the purposes of the first principle personal data shall not be treated as processed fairly unless the data subject has, as soon as reasonably practicable, been provided with, at a minimum —

(a) the identity of the data controller; and  
(b) the purpose for which the data are to be processed.

# Seventh principle: processing contract to ensure reliability

3. If processing of personal data is carried out by a data processor on behalf of a data controller, the data controller shall not to be regarded as complying with the seventh principle unless the processing is carried out under a contract —

(a) that is made or evidenced in writing;  
(b) under which the data processor is to act only on instructions from the data controller; and  
(c) that requires the data processor to comply with obligations equivalent to those imposed on a data controller by the seventh principle.

# Eighth principle: what is adequate protection in foreign country

4. For the purposes of the eighth principle, an adequate level of protection is one that is adequate in all the circumstances of the case, having regard, among other things, to —

(a) the nature of the personal data;  
(b) the country or territory of origin of the information contained in the data;  
(c) the country or territory of final destination of that information;  
(d) the purposes for which and period during which the personal data are intended to be processed;  
(e) the law in force in the country or territory in question;  
(f) the international obligations of that country or territory;  
(g) any relevant codes of conduct or other rules that are enforceable in that country or territory, whether generally or by arrangement in particular cases; and  
(h) any security measures taken in respect of the data in that country or territory.

# Exceptions to Eighth principle

5. The eighth principle does not apply to a transfer falling within Schedule 4, except in such circumstances and to such extent as may be prescribed by regulations.

# Eighth principle: European Union finding decisive

6. (1) If in any proceedings under this Act a question arises as to whether the requirement of the eighth principle as to an adequate level of protection is met in relation to the transfer of any personal data to a country or territory outside the Islands which is a member state of the European Union or with respect to which a European Union finding has been made in relation to transfers of the kind in question, that question shall be determined in accordance with that finding.

(2) In this paragraph "European Union finding" means a finding of the European Commission, under the procedure provided for in Article 93 of Directive 2016/679/EC or such other provision or instrument as may for the time being be in force on the protection of data subjects with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, that a country or territory outside the European Economic Area does, or does not, ensure an adequate level of protection within the meaning of Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or such other provision or instrument as may for the time being be in force for that purpose.
