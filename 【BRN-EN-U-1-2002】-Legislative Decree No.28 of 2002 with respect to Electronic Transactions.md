# Article 5

# Legal Recognition of Electronic Records in Evidence

1. Electronic records have the established legal recognition in evidence specified in the common documents. Information shall not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely on the grounds that it is wholly or partly in the form of an electronic record or not contained in the electronic record purporting to give rise to such legal effect, but is merely referred to in that electronic record.  
2. Where a rule of law requires information to be in writing, or provides a legal effect if it is not, that requirement is met by an electronic record provided the information contained therein is accessible so as to be useable for subsequent reference whether by transmission, printing or otherwise.  
3. Where a rule of law requires a person to provide information in writing to another person, that requirement is met by the provision of that information in an electronic form that is:

(i) accessible by the addressee so as to be usable for subsequent reference whether by transmission, printing or otherwise; and  
(ii) capable of being retained by the addressee.

4. Information in the form of an electronic record shall be presumed to be authentic unless evidence is adduced;

# Electronic Signature

1. Use of electronic signature shall not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely on the grounds that it is wholly or partly in electronic form.  
2. Where the law requires a signature of a person, or provides for a legal effect if a document is not signed, an electronic signature of that person satisfies the requirements of this Law.  
3. In any legal proceedings involving an electronic signature that is associated with an Accredited Certificate, it shall be presumed unless the parties have agreed otherwise or unless evidence to the contrary is adduced that:

(i) such electronic signature is the signature of the person to whom it correlates;  
(ii) such electronic signature was affixed by that person to whom it correlates for the purpose of signing such electronic record;  
(iii) the electronic record that is signed with such signature has not been altered since the time at which the electronic signature was affixed.

4. If the electronic signature is not made with the use of an Accredited Certificate, the presumption of an authenticity created under the provisions of the preceding Paragraph shall not be attached to the electronic signature or record.

# Article 7

# Originals

1. A legal requirement that a document be presented or retained in its original form is satisfied by presenting or retaining the document as an electronic record provided:

(i) there exists a reliable assurance as to the integrity of the information contained in the electronic record, from the time the electronic record was first created in its final form as an electronic record or written form;  
(ii) where it is required that the original document is to be presented to a person, that electronic record is accessible, and capable of being displayed in an intelligible form to the concerned person.

2. For the purpose of Paragraph (1)(a) of this Article, the following shall be observed:

(i) the criterion for assessing integrity is whether the information in the electronic record has remained complete and unaltered, apart from the addition of any endorsement or changes which arise in the normal course of generating, processing, transmitting, storing or safekeeping and displaying; and  
(ii) the standard of reliability shall be assessed in light of all the circumstances in which, including the purpose for which, the record was created.

# Article 8

# Legal Requirements for One or More Copies

If the use of an electronic record is accepted between certain parties or otherwise permitted by law, a requirement that a copy or multiple copies of a document be provided to a person is satisfied by the provision of a single electronic record to that person.

# Article 9

# Retention of Documents

1. A legal requirement to retain documents, records or information that is created, sent or received in a paper form or electronically is satisfied by its retention as an electronic record if the following conditions are satisfied:

(i) sent by the originator;  
(ii) sent with the implied or express consent by an originator or an electronic agent of the originator; or

- any communication by the addressee, automated or otherwise; or  
- any communication by the addressee, sufficient to indicate the originator that the electronic record has been received.

(b) Where the originator has stated that the electronic record is conditional upon receipt of an acknowledgement, unless the parties agree otherwise the electronic record is treated as though it has never been sent, until the acknowledgement is received.  
(c) Where the originator has not stated that the validity of the electronic record is conditional on receipt of an acknowledgement, and the acknowledgement has not been received by the originator within the time specified or agreed or, if no time has been specified or agreed, within a reasonable time, the originator may give notice to the addressee stating that no acknowledgement has been received and specifying a reasonable time by which the acknowledgement must be received and if the acknowledgement is not received within the time specified may, upon notice to the addressee, treat the electronic record as though it is null and void or invoke any other rights the originator may have.
