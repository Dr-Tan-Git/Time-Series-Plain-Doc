(8) The controller shall document the factual or legal reasons on which the decision is based.

# Unofficial Translation

# Article 58

Right of rectification and deletion and to restriction of data processing

1) The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the rectification of any inaccurate data concerning him or her. Especially, in cases of statements or assessments, the question of accuracy is not relevant for the content of the statement or assessment. If the accuracy or inaccuracy of the data cannot be verified, the controller shall restrict the processing instead of erasing the data. In that case the controller shall inform the data subject before lifting the restriction of processing. The data subject may also have incomplete personal data completed, if doing so is appropriate when taking into account the purposes of processing.  
2) The data subject has the right to request the erasure of personal data concerning him or her where processing such data is unlawful, knowledge of the data is no longer necessary for the performance of tasks, or the data must be erased to comply with a legal obligation.  
3) Instead of erasure, the controller may restrict the processing if:  
a) there is reason to believe that erasure would adversely affect legitimate interests of the data subject;  
b) the data must be retained for the purposes of evidence in proceedings serving the purposes of Article 45; or  
c) erasure would be impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort because of the specific type of storage.

Data which is restricted pursuant to the first sentence may only be processed for purposes which prevented their erasure.

4) If the controller has rectified inaccurate data, he or she shall inform the body, from which he or she received the personal data, about the rectification. In cases of rectification, erasure or restriction of processing pursuant to paras.1 to 3, the controller shall inform the recipients who received inaccurate data about these measures. The recipient shall rectify or erase the data or restrict their processing.  
5) The controller shall inform the data subject in writing about any refusal to rectify or erase personal data or restrict its processing. This shall not apply if the provision of this information would result in an impairment pursuant to Article 56 (2). The information according to the first sentence shall include the reasons for the refusal unless providing the reasons would undermine the intended purpose of the refusal.  
6) Article 57 (7) and (8) shall apply accordingly.

Where a request pursuant to Articles 57 and 58 is manifestly unfounded or excessive, the controller may charge a reasonable fee, or may refuse to act on the request. In this case, the controller must be able to demonstrate the manifestly unfounded or excessive character of the request.

4) If the controller has reasonable doubts as to the identity of the data subject who submitted the request pursuant to Articles 57 or 58, the controller may request further information that is necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject.

# Article 60

# Right to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Authority

1) Without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedy, every data subject may lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Authority if the data subject believes that the processing of personal data for the purposes as set out in Article 45 by a public body infringes his or her rights. This shall not apply to the processing of personal data by courts, if they have processed these data in the context of their judicial activities. The Data Protection Authority shall inform the data subject on the progress and the outcome of the complaint and of the possibility of a judicial remedy pursuant to Article 20.

2) If a data subject lodges a complaint with the Data Protection Authority instead of the competent supervisory authority in another EEA or Schengen member state, the Data Protection Authority shall transmit the complaint to the competent supervisory authority without delay. In this case, the data subject shall be informed about the forwarding of his or her complaint and, upon request of the data subject, the Data Protection Authority shall provide further support.

Joint controllers shall determine their respective tasks and duties regarding data protection in a mutual agreement and in a transparent way, unless these tasks and responsibilities are

# Unofficial Translation

already determined by law. In particular, this agreement must indicate which of them shall meet which information obligations, and how and with respect to whom data subjects may exercise their rights. Such an agreement shall not prevent data subjects from asserting their rights against each of the joint controllers.

# Article 63

# Requirements regarding the security of data processing

1) The controller and the processor, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, in particular as regards the processing of special categories of personal data. The controller shall take into account the relevant generally recognised technical guidelines and recommendations in information technology.  
2) The measures mentioned in paragraph 1 may include pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data, if such means are possible in view of the purposes of processing. The measures pursuant to paragraph 1 shall ensure

2) The notification referred to in paragraph 1 shall describe in clear and plain language the nature of the personal data breach and shall contain at least the information and measures referred to in Article 64 (3), (b), (c) and (d).  
3) The notification according to paragraph 1 shall not be required if:

a) the controller has implemented appropriate technical and organisational protection measures, and those measures were applied to the personal data affected by the personal data breach, in particular those that render the personal data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it, such as encryption;  
(b) the controller has taken subsequent measures which ensure that the high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in paragraph 1 is no longer likely to materialize;  
(c) it would involve a disproportionate effort; in this case, there shall instead be a public communication or a similar measure whereby the data subjects are informed in an equally effective manner.  
4) If the controller has not communicated the personal data breach to the data subjects, the Data Protection Authority, having considered the likelihood of the personal data breach resulting in a high risk pursuant to paragraph 1, may decide that the conditions referred to in paragraph 3 have not been met.  
5) The notification of data subjects pursuant to paragraph 1 may be delayed, restricted or omitted under the conditions referred to in Article 56 (2) unless the interests of the data subjects outweigh those of the controller owing to the high risk resulting from the personal data breach as referred to in paragraph 1.

The controller shall cooperate with the Data Protection Authority in the performance of his or her tasks.

Article 68

Consultation of the Data Protection Authority

1) The controller shall consult the Data Protection Authority prior to processing which will form part of a new filing system if:  
a) a data protection impact assessment as provided for in Article 66 indicates that the processing would result in a high risk in the absence of measures taken by the controller to mitigate the risk; or  
b) the type of processing, in particular, where using new technologies, mechanisms or procedures, involves a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects.

# Unofficial Translation

The Data Protection Authority may establish a list of the processing operations which are subject to prior consultation pursuant to sentence 1.

2) In cases of paragraph 1, the following shall be submitted to the Data Protection Authority:  
a) the data protection impact assessment pursuant to Article 66;  
b) where applicable, information on the respective responsibilities of the controller, joint controllers and processors involved in the processing;  
c) information on the purposes and means of the envisaged processing;  
d) information on the measures and safeguards intended to protect the legally protected interests of the data subjects; and  
e) name and contact details of the data protection officer.

4) The controller who transfers data according to paragraph 1 shall take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient forwards data to other third states or other international organizations only if the controller has given prior authorization. When deciding on the approval of such transfers, the controller

b) the controller has assessed all the circumstances surrounding the transfer and concludes that appropriate safeguards exist for the protection of personal data.  
2) The controller shall record any transfer according to paragraph 1 lett. b.
