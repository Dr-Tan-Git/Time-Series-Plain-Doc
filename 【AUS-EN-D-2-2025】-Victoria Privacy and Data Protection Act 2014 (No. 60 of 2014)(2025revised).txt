	1.2	An organisation must collect personal information only by lawful and fair means and not in an unreasonably intrusive way.
	1.3	At or before the time (or, if that is not practicable, as soon as practicable after) an organisation collects personal information about an individual from the individual, the organisation must take reasonable steps to ensure that the individual is aware of-

	(ii)	in the case of disclosure-the organisation reasonably believes that the recipient of the information will not disclose the information; or
	(d)	the organisation reasonably believes that the use or disclosure is necessary to lessen or prevent-
Sch. 1 cl. 2.1(d)(i) amended by No. 23/2017 s. 22(1).

	(g)	the organisation reasonably believes that the use or disclosure is reasonably necessary for one or more of the following by or on behalf of a law enforcement agency-

	6	Principle 6-Access and Correction
	6.1	If an organisation holds personal information about an individual, it must provide the individual with access to the information on request by the individual, except to the extent that-
Sch. 1 cl. 6.1(a) amended by No. 23/2017 s. 22(2).
	(a)	providing access would pose a serious threat to the life or health of any individual; or

	(b)	providing access would have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of other individuals; or
	(c)	the request for access is frivolous or vexatious; or

	(d)	the information relates to existing legal proceedings between the organisation and the individual, and the information would not be accessible by the process of discovery or subpoena in those proceedings; or
	(e)	providing access would reveal the intentions of the organisation in relation to negotiations with the individual in such a way as to prejudice those negotiations; or
	(f)	providing access would be unlawful; or

	(ii)	the enforcement of laws relating to the confiscation of the proceeds of crime; or
	(iii)	the protection of public revenue; or
	(iv)	the prevention, detection, investigation or remedying of seriously improper conduct; or

by or on behalf of a law enforcement agency; or
	(j)	ASIO, ASIS or a law enforcement agency performing a lawful security function asks the organisation not to provide access to the information on the basis that providing access would be likely to cause damage to the security of Australia.
	6.2	However, where providing access would reveal evaluative information generated within the organisation in connection with a commercially sensitive decision-making process, the organisation may give the individual an explanation for the commercially sensitive decision rather than direct access to the information.
	6.3	If the organisation is not required to provide the individual with access to the information because of one or more of IPP 6.1(a) to (j) (inclusive), the organisation must, if reasonable, consider whether the use of mutually agreed intermediaries would allow sufficient access to meet the needs of both parties.
	6.4	If an organisation charges for providing access to personal information, the organisation-
	(a)	must advise an individual who requests access to personal information that the organisation will provide access on the payment of the prescribed fee; and
	(b)	may refuse access to the personal information until the fee is paid.
	6.5	If an organisation holds personal information about an individual and the individual is able to establish that the information is not accurate, complete and up to date, the organisation must take reasonable steps to correct the information so that it is accurate, complete and up to date.
	6.6	If the individual and the organisation disagree about whether the information is accurate, complete and up to date, and the individual asks the organisation to associate with the information a statement claiming that the information is not accurate, complete or up to date, the organisation must take reasonable steps to do so.
	6.7	An organisation must provide reasons for denial of access or a refusal to correct personal information.
	6.8	If an individual requests access to, or the correction of, personal information held by an organisation, the organisation must-
	(a)	provide access, or reasons for the denial of access; or
	(b)	correct the personal information, or provide reasons for the refusal to correct the personal information; or
	(c)	provide reasons for the delay in responding to the request for access to or for the correction of personal information-
as soon as practicable, but no later than 45 days after receiving the request.
	7	Principle 7-Unique Identifiers
	7.1	An organisation must not assign unique identifiers to individuals unless the assignment of unique identifiers is necessary to enable the organisation to carry out any of its functions efficiently.
	7.2	An organisation must not adopt as its own unique identifier of an individual a unique identifier of the individual that has been assigned by another organisation unless-
	(a)	it is necessary to enable the organisation to carry out any of its functions efficiently; or

Interpretation
As from 1 January 2001, amendments to section 36 of the ILA have the following effects:

This includes headings to Parts, Divisions or Subdivisions in a Schedule; sections; clauses; items; tables; columns; examples; diagrams; notes or forms.  See section 36(1A)(2A).
?	Examples, diagrams or notes
All examples, diagrams or notes included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 form part of that Act.  Any examples, diagrams or notes inserted in an Act which was passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, form part of that Act.  See section 36(3A).
