# Article 3

Whenever the competent authorities in Member States exercise their powers pursuant to Article 28(3) of Directive 95/46/EC leading to the suspension or definitive ban of data flows to Andorra in order to protect individuals with regard to the processing of their personal data, the Member State concerned shall, without delay, inform the Commission which will forward the information to the other Member States.

# Article 4

1. The Commission shall, on an ongoing basis, monitor developments in the Andorran legal order that could affect the functioning of this Decision, including developments concerning access to personal data by public authorities, with a view to assessing whether Andorra continues to ensure an adequate level of protection of personal data.  
2. The Member States and the Commission shall inform each other of cases where the action of bodies responsible for ensuring compliance with the standard of protection in Andorra fails to secure such compliance.  
3. The Member States and the Commission shall inform each other of any indications that interferences by Andorran public authorities responsible for national security, law enforcement or other public interests with the right of individuals to the protection of their personal data go beyond what is strictly necessary, or that there is no effective legal protection against such interferences.

4. Where evidence shows that an adequate level of protection is no longer ensured, including in situations referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, the Commission shall inform the competent Andorran authority and, if necessary, propose draft measures in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 31(2) of Directive 95/46/EC with a view to repealing or suspending this Decision or limiting its scope.
