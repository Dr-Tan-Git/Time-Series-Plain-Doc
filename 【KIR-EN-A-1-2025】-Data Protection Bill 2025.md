# PART IV - RIGHTS OF A DATA SUBJECT

# 15. Rights of confirmation, access, correction and deletion

(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (4), a data subject has the right to obtain from a controller for reasonable purposes, at no expense and without unreasonable delay:

(a) confirmation as to whether or not the controller is processing, or a person is processing on behalf of the controller, personal data relating to the data subject and, if so, the source of such personal data;  
(b) a copy of such personal data in a commonly used electronic format:  
(c) correction, or if correction is not feasible or suitable, deletion of any such personal data that are inaccurate, out of date, incomplete or misleading; and  
(d) deletion of any such personal data which the controller is not entitled to retain.

(2) If a data subject's request under subsection (1) is manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of its repetitive character, a controller may charge a data subject a reasonable fee in relation to a request or refuse the request.  
(3) Prior to making any correction under subsection (1)(c), a controller may require sufficient evidence of the accuracy of such correction.  
(4) A controller may impose a fee for receipt of a copy of personal data under subsection (1)(b) to the extent such fee is otherwise prescribed under applicable law.

(1) A data subject has the right to:

(a) withdraw consent to processing previously given to a controller under Sections 10(e)(iii), 17(c), 11(2)(a) or 24(a) or  
(b) object to processing where no lawful basis of processing applies under Sections 11(2)(b) or 24(b).

(2) A controller shall ensure that it is as easy for the data subject to exercise the rights under subsection (1) as to give consent or voluntarily provide the personal data, and that he or she is informed of the consequences of doing so upon expressing a desire to exercise the right.  
(3) When a data subject exercises the rights under subsection (1), the controller shall promptly cease any processing to the extent that it relies solely on the applicable sections of this Act.

# 17. Right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing

A data subject has the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing of personal data which produces legal or similar significant effects concerning such data subject, except where such decisions are:

(a) necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between the data subject and a controller;  
(b) authorised by a written law which establishes suitable measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject; or  
(c) authorised by the consent of the data subject.

# PART V - DATA SECURITY AND PERSONAL DATA IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

# 18. Security, integrity and confidentiality of personal data

(1) A person processing personal data shall implement, and ensure any other person processing data on its behalf (including any person engaging in downstream processing of such personal data) implements, appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security, integrity and confidentiality of the personal data including protections against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, misuse or alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access.

(2) In implementing measures under subsection (1), a person shall take into account:

(a) the amount of the personal data;  
(b) the nature, degree and likelihood of harm to data subjects that could result from the loss, disclosure or other misuse of the personal data;  
(c) the extent of the processing;  
(d) the period of data retention; and

(c) processes to ensure security, integrity, confidentiality, availability and resilience of processing systems and services;  
(d) processes to restore availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident;  
(e) periodic assessments of risks to processing systems, services and transmission over electronic communications networks;  
(f) regular testing, assessing and evaluation of the effectiveness of the measures implemented against current and evolving risks identified; and  
(g) regular updating of the measures and introduction of new measures to address shortcomings in effectiveness and accommodate evolving risks.

# 19. Personal data breaches

(1) Each person processing personal data on behalf of another person shall inform the controller or such other person who or which has engaged it as soon as practicable after having become aware of it:

(a) when a personal data breach has occurred, regardless of whether it requires notification under Section 20; or  
(b) when it receives a notification under this subsection from any person it has engaged to process personal data on its behalf.

(2) The information provided under subsection (1) shall include the information required to be included in a notification under Section 20(5), to the extent known and applicable.  
(3) Each person shall keep a record of any personal data breach with respect to personal data processed by it, regardless of whether it requires notification under Section 20, including the facts relating to the personal data breach, its effects and the remedial action taken in a manner that enables the Office to verify compliance with this Part.  
(4) For each personal data breach with respect to personal data processed by it, a controller shall determine whether such breach meets the requirements of Section 20(1), keep a written record of its analysis of the factors set out in Section 20(1) and make such record available to the Office upon request.

# 20. Harmful personal data breaches

(1) This section applies to any personal data breach that has resulted in, or is likely to result in, significant harm to affected data subjects, taking into account:

(a) whether the personal data are protected by encryption, methods of de-identification, or other security measures that may reduce the risk of harm to affected data subjects;

(b) the nature of the harm that has resulted or is likely to result to affected individuals;  
(c) any action taken or expected to be taken to reduce the harm or risk of harm following the breach;  
(d) in the case of unauthorised access to or disclosure of personal data, how the data might be used by any person having such access or to which disclosure may be made;  
(e) in the case of loss, destruction or alteration of personal data, whether the personal data have been recovered and the impact on the processing; and  
(f) any other factors relevant to assessing the harm or risk of harm, or mitigation thereof, to affected data subjects.

(2) When a personal data breach has occurred, the relevant controller shall, as soon as practicable after having become aware of the breach, notify:

(a) the Office; and  
(b) each affected data subject.

(3) If a direct notification to each affected data subject under subsection (2) would involve disproportionate effort or expense or is otherwise not feasible, the controller may instead notify data subjects by public notification through one or more widely used media sources.  
(4) The Office may at any time make a public notification about a personal data breach if it considers the public notification made by a controller to data subjects under subsection (2) inadequate.  
(5) The notifications under subsections (2) or (3) shall:

(a) set out the nature of the personal data breach including, where possible, the categories and approximate numbers of data subjects and personal data records concerned;  
(b) communicate the name and contact details of a point of contact of the controller where more information can be obtained;  
(c) describe the likely consequences to affected data subjects of the personal data breach;  
(d) describe the measures taken or expected to be taken by the controller, or any other person processing the personal data on the controller's behalf, to address the personal data breach, including any measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects; and  
(e) in the case of a notification made directly to affected data subjects or a public notification, provide advice about measures the affected data subjects could take to mitigate effectively the possible adverse effects of the personal data breach.

(6) To the extent that it is not possible to provide information under subsection (5) at the same time, the information may be provided in phases without undue further delay.

# 21. Data protection impact assessments

(1) Where processing by a controller of major importance is likely to expose 10,000 or more data subjects to a high risk of significant harm by virtue of the nature, scope, context and purposes of such processing, such controller shall, prior to the processing:

(a) carry out a data protection impact assessment; and  
(b) submit a data protection impact assessment report to the Office.

(2) For purposes of this section, a "data protection impact assessment" is an assessment of the impact of the envisaged processing on the protection of personal data comprising:

(a) a systematic description of the envisaged processing, its purpose, and the lawful basis of processing under Section 11;  
(b) an assessment of the necessity of the processing in relation to the purposes for which the personal data would be processed;  
(c) an assessment of the risks of harm to data subjects; and  
(d) an evaluation of the likely effectiveness of the measures envisaged to address the risks and the safeguards, security measures and mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal data and to demonstrate compliance with this Act.

(3) If notwithstanding the measures envisaged under subsection (2)(d), the data protection impact assessment indicates that the processing has a high risk of significant harm to data subjects, the controller of major importance shall proceed with such processing only upon approval of, and subject to any conditions imposed by, the Office.  
(4) This section shall not apply until the second anniversary of the date on which this Act enters into force.

# 22. Guidance on compliance

The Office may issue guidance on the steps to be taken by persons to comply with the personal data breach and data protection impact assessment obligations in this Part.

# 23. Adequate protection of personal data processed or transferred outside Kiribati

(1) Except as permitted in Section 24, a person that processes personal data outside Kiribati or transfers personal data to a person outside Kiribati shall take reasonable steps to verify or ensure, as applicable, that there is adequate protection with respect to the personal data.  
(2) For purposes of this section, there is "adequate protection" with respect to personal data processed or transferred outside Kiribati if:

(a) the person processing or receiving the personal data is subject to restrictions and obligations substantially similar to those set forth in Parts III and V;  
(b) the data subject has rights substantially similar to those found in Part IV; and  
(c) such restrictions, obligations and rights are substantially enforceable.

(3) Adequate protection may be afforded by any one or combination of the following:

(a) the laws of the jurisdiction in which the processing occurs or to which the personal data are transferred or may be subsequently transferred;  
(b) binding corporate rules, contractual clauses, a code of conduct, certification mechanism or other measures; or  
(c) if the person processing or receiving the personal data outside Kiribati is an international organisation, the policies and administrative and technical measures of such organisation.

(4) The Office may:

(a) issue guidelines with respect to the assessment of whether there is adequate protection; or  
(b) designate any international organisation, country, region or specified sector within a country, law, binding corporate rules, contractual clauses, code of conduct, certification mechanism or other measure as affording or not affording adequate protection under this Part.

(5) The absence of any guideline or designation by the Office under subsection (4) with respect to any country, region or specified sector within a country, international organization or measure shall not imply that it does or does not afford adequate protection under this Part.  
(6) The Office may prohibit processing or transfer of personal data or specified categories of personal data outside Kiribati to a specified jurisdiction, a specified organisation or under specified measures:

(a) on the basis that the personal data will not be afforded adequate protection; or  
(b) for reasons of national security.

(7) The reasonableness of steps under subsection (1) shall be assessed taking into account the factors referred to in Section 18(2).  
(8) Notwithstanding Section 5(2), for purposes of this section, a "transfer" of personal data by a person includes any transfer to a second person processing such personal data on the first person's behalf.

# 24. Other bases for processing and transfer of personal data outside Kiribati

A person may process personal data outside Kiribati or transfer personal data to a person outside Kiribati if:

(a) the data subject has given and not withdrawn consent to such processing or transfer after having been informed of the possible risks of such processing or transfer to the data subject due to the possible absence of an adequate level of protection;  
(b) the data subject has voluntarily provided personal data to the controller, or a person processing personal data on such controller's behalf, for the specified purpose of such processing or transfer, and the data subject has not indicated that he or she does not consent to such processing;

# LEGAL REPORT

I hereby certify my opinion that none of the provisions of the above Act conflict with the Constitution and that the Beretitenti may properly assent to the Act.

MS PAULINE BEAITAU

ATTORNEY GENERAL

$17^{\mathrm{th}}$  February 2025

# EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

# BACKGROUND

With the increasing digitalization of services and the growing importance of data in the modern economy, there is a pressing need to ensure adequate protection of personal data while fostering innovation and economic growth. The Data Protection Act 2025 (Act) sets out a comprehensive framework to govern the processing of personal data in Kiribati that is consistent with international standards. It ensures that personal data processing is subject to appropriate safeguards, grants rights to individuals concerning their personal data, and promotes the beneficial use of personal data in the digital economy.

# PART I - PRELIMINARY

Part I specifies the name of the Act as the Data Protection Act 2025, indicates that it commences on a date to be appointed by the Secretary and sets out a list of defined terms that include critical data protection concepts. It also names the Secretary as responsible for the administration of the Act, permitting delegation of this function to officers in the Ministry.

This part defines the scope of application of the Act to include processing of personal data within Kiribati and in limited circumstances outside Kiribati and specifies that the Act binds the Republic. It also sets out exemptions and exclusions from the application of the Act, including the processing of personal data for personal, recreational or household purposes or the exercise or defence of legal claims, certain actions taken by legally authorised authorities relating to national security, law enforcement, and public health emergencies, and processing for journalistic, educational, artistic or literary expression.

This part also sets out the objectives of the Act, which include the protection of individuals from risks arising for the processing of personal data, promotion of practices to protect personal data and ensure it is processed fairly, lawfully and in a transparent manner, and advancement of digital government services and the use of personal data in the digital economy.

# PART II - ADMINISTRATION

Part II designates the Digital Transformation Office (the Office) as responsible for the enforcement of the Act. It sets out the functions of the Office under the Act, including promoting awareness of personal data protection, receiving complaints of and investigating potential violations of the Act, imposing penalties in case of such violations, designating counties as affording adequate personal data protection, submitting proposals to the Secretary for regulations to be made under the Act, and generally implementing the provisions of the Act. This part also requires the Director to prepare and submit annual reports describing the Office's activities and developments in relation to data protection in the prior year.

# PART III - PRINCIPLES GOVERNING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA

Part III sets out the principles governing the processing of personal data applicable to controllers under the Act. It requires that any processing of personal data be for an explicit purpose, not exceed that purpose, be limited to the extent necessary to achieve such purpose, be adequate, relevant and

kept accurate to the extent required by such purpose, and not be retained for longer than necessary to achieve such purpose, subject to certain exceptions.

This part requires controllers to process personal data fairly and in a transparent manner. Processing is not permitted unless one of twelve conditions is met, including individual consent to such processing, compliance with a controller's legal obligations, authorisation by law, various emergency situations and the public nature of the personal data. Further processing is also permitted when it is compatible with the original purpose for which the personal data was processed. This part also clarifies the ability of a legal guardian or other appropriate legal representative to give consent to processing on behalf of children or other individuals lacking capacity, respectively.

This part sets out mandatory disclosures that must be made to individuals when a controller collects personal data, subject to certain exceptions. It also requires controllers to take reasonable measures to ensure that any person that processes personal data the controller's behalf does so in a manner that ensures compliance with the Act. Such reasonable measures include a written agreement between the controller and such person which satisfies certain requirements.

# PART IV - RIGHTS OF A DATA SUBJECT

Part IV grants rights to individuals relating to the processing of their personal data. These rights comprise the rights to know whether or not a controller is processing the individual's personal data, receive a copy of any such personal data, correct any such personal data that are inaccurate, out of date, incomplete or misleading, and have the controller delete any such personal data it is not entitled to retain. It also grants individuals the right to withdraw any consent given under the Act relating to processing of personal data and the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing.

# PART V - DATA SECURITY AND PERSONAL DATA IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

Part V sets out obligations on any person processing personal data to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security, integrity and confidentiality of personal such personal data, including protections against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, misuse or alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access. The appropriateness of such measures can be determined with respect to factors such as the amount of the personal data and the risks of harm to individuals. Such measures may include de-identification and encryption of the personal data.

This part also addresses actions to be taken upon the occurrence of personal data breaches. Any person processing personal data on behalf of a controller must report all such breaches to the person who engaged it and keep records of the facts of such breach. In addition, controllers are required to notify the Office and each affected individual when a personal data breach results in, or is likely to result in, significant harm to affected individuals. This part sets out factors to take into consideration in determining whether this threshold is met, including whether the personal data are protected by encryption, pseudonymisation or other methods of de-identification, or other security measures that may reduce the risk of harm, and mitigating action taken or expected to be taken. If a direct notification to each affected individual would involve disproportionate effort or expense or is otherwise not feasible, the controller may instead make a public notification through one or more widely used media sources.

When certain controllers plan to engage in processing that is likely to expose 10,000 or more data subjects to a high risk of significant harm by virtue of the nature, scope, context and purposes of such processing, such controllers must carry out a data protection impact assessment and submit it to the Office prior to the processing. This assessment must describe the processing, assess its necessity and the risk of harm to individuals and evaluate the effectiveness measures envisaged to address such harm. If such harms cannot be effectively mitigated, then such processing may only proceed with the approval of the Office. These requirements do not apply until the [first/second] anniversary of the date on which the Act enters into force.

# PART VI - PROCESSING AND TRANSFERS OUTSIDE KIRIBATI

Part VI governs processing and transfers of personal data outside Kiribati. In general, a person may engage in such extraterritorial processing or transfers only if the person can verify that adequate protections are in place. Adequate protection means that key protections under the Act would continue to apply outside Kiribati. Such protection could be achieved if the extraterritorial jurisdiction has sufficient laws in place or the processing is protected through binding corporate rules, contractual clauses, a code of conduct, certification mechanism or other measures. The Office may designate certain jurisdictions or measures as providing or not providing adequate protection and may prohibit any extraterritorial processing or transfers of certain categories of personal data on the basis of national security.

This part also provides a list of alternative bases for extraterritorial processing and transfers of personal data. These include consent of the individual, actions taken in response to certain medical emergencies and compliance with obligations under international agreements with third countries, such as those governing mutual legal assistance.

Under this part, any person processing or transferring personal outside Kiribati must keep a written record of its compliance with this part and make such record available to the Office upon request.

# PART VII - ENFORCEMENT

Part VII governs enforcement of the Act. It permits any individual who is aggrieved by any act or omission of a person resulting in a violation of the Act to lodge a complaint with the Office.

The Office may initiate an investigation on the basis of a complaint or of its own accord where it has reason to believe a person has violated or is likely to violate the Act. This part grants the Office certain powers necessary to conduct investigations, including the appointment of officers, upon approval of the Secretary, to conduct interviews, require provision of information and conduct searches and seizures pursuant to a court-issued warrant.

Upon completing an investigation and finding that a person has violated the Act, the Office may issue a notice to such person to take or refrain from action, remedy the violation or pay an administrative penalty. Affected individuals and persons who are the subject of a notice of the Office may apply to the appropriate court within thirty days after the notice was issued for judicial review. Failure to comply with a notice issued by the Office is considered a criminal offence for which such person is liable to a fine.

In addition, this part grants individuals who suffer injury, loss or harm as a result of a violation of the Act by a person processing personal data the ability to recover damages by way of civil proceedings in the appropriate court from such person.

# PART VIII - MISCELLANEOUS

Part VIII grants the Minister the power to make regulations for the implementation of the Act. It also specifies that the Act should not be interpreted to limit obligations imposed on any person processing personal data or the rights of any data subject granted otherwise under other laws.

# CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS

The Act sets out amendments to the Digital Government Act 2023, Business Names Act 2021, and the Companies Act 2021 to harmonise them with the terminology and requirements under the Act.
