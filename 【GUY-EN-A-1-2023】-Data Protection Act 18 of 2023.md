(c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which the personal data is processed;  
(d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date and every reasonable step shall be taken to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which it is processed, is erased or rectified without delay;

(5) Subsection (1)(d) is not contravened by reason of any inaccuracy in personal data which accurately record information obtained by the data controller from the data subject or a third party in a case where
