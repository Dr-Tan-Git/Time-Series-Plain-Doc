1. A consumer may invoke the consumer rights authorized pursuant to this section at any time by submitting a request to the controller, through the means specified by the controller pursuant to section 715D.4, subsection 6, specifying the consumer rights the consumer wishes to invoke. A known child's parent or legal guardian may invoke such consumer rights on behalf of the known child regarding processing personal data belonging to the child. A controller shall comply with an authenticated consumer request to exercise all of the

following:

a. To confirm whether a controller is processing the consumer's personal data and to access such personal data.

b. To delete personal data provided by the consumer.

c. To obtain a copy of the consumer's personal data, except as to personal data that is defined as "personal information" pursuant to section 715C.l that is subject to security breach protection, that the consumer previously provided to the controller in a portable and, to the extent technically practicable, readily usable format that allows the consumer to transmit the data to another controller without hindrance, where the processing is carried out by automated means.

$d$ . To opt out of the sale of personal data.

2. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a controller shall comply with a request by a consumer to exercise the consumer rights authorized pursuant to this section as follows:

a. A controller shall respond to the consumer without undue delay, but in all cases within ninety days of receipt of a request submitted pursuant to the methods described in this section. The response period may be extended once by forty-five additional days when reasonably necessary upon considering the complexity and number of the consumer's requests by informing the consumer of any such extension within the initial ninety-day response period, together with the reason for the extension.

b. If a controller declines to take action regarding the consumer's request, the controller shall inform the consumer without undue delay of the justification for declining to take action, except in the case of a suspected fraudulent request, in which case the controller may state that the controller was unable to authenticate the request. The controller shall also provide instructions for appealing the decision pursuant to subsection 3.

c. Information provided in response to a consumer request shall be provided by a controller free of charge, up to twice annually per consumer. If a request from a consumer is manifestly unfounded, excessive, repetitive, technically unfeasible, or the controller reasonably believes that the

primary purpose of the request is not to exercise a consumer right, the controller may charge the consumer a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying with the request or decline to act on the request. The controller bears the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded, excessive, repetitive, or technically unfeasible nature of the request.

d. If a controller is unable to authenticate a request using commercially reasonable efforts, the controller shall not be required to comply with a request to initiate an action under this section and may request that the consumer provide additional information reasonably necessary to authenticate the consumer and the consumer's request.

3. A controller shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal the controller's refusal to take action on a request within a reasonable period of time after the consumer's receipt of the decision pursuant to this section. The appeal process shall be conspicuously available and similar to the process for submitting requests to initiate action pursuant to this section. Within sixty days of receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decision. If the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the consumer with an online mechanism through which the consumer may contact the attorney general to submit a complaint.

Sec. 4. NEW SECTION. 715D.4 Data controller duties.

1. A controller shall adopt and implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical data security practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of personal data. Such data security practices shall be appropriate to the volume and nature of the personal data at issue.

2. A controller shall not process sensitive data collected from a consumer for a nonexempt purpose without the consumer having been presented with clear notice and an opportunity to opt out of such processing, or, in the case of the processing of sensitive data concerning a known child, without processing such data in accordance with the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. §6501 et seq.

3. A controller shall not process personal data in violation of state and federal laws that prohibit unlawful discrimination against a consumer. A controller shall not discriminate against a consumer for exercising any of the consumer rights contained in this chapter, including denying goods or services, charging different prices or rates for goods or services, or providing a different level of quality of goods and services to the consumer. However, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require a controller to provide a product or service that requires the personal data of a consumer that the controller does not collect or maintain or to prohibit a controller from offering a different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods or services for no fee, if the consumer has exercised the consumer's right to opt out pursuant to section 715D.3 or the offer is related to a consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts, or club card program.

4. Any provision of a contract or agreement that purports to waive or limit in any way consumer rights pursuant to section 715D.3 shall be deemed contrary to public policy and shall be void and unenforceable.

5. A controller shall provide consumers with a reasonably accessible, clear, and meaningful privacy notice that includes the following:

a. The categories of personal data processed by the controller.

b. The purpose for processing personal data.

c. How consumers may exercise their consumer rights pursuant to section 715D.3, including how a consumer may appeal a controller's decision with regard to the consumer's request.

d. The categories of personal data that the controller shares with third parties, if any.

e. The categories of third parties, if any, with whom the controller shares personal data.

6. If a controller sells a consumer's personal data to third parties or engages in targeted advertising, the controllers shall clearly and conspicuously disclose such activity, as well as the manner in which a consumer may exercise the right to opt

out of such activity.

7. A controller shall establish, and shall describe in a privacy notice, secure and reliable means for consumers to submit a request to exercise their consumer rights under this chapter. Such means shall consider the ways in which consumers normally interact with the controller, the need for secure and reliable communication of such requests, and the ability of the controller to authenticate the identity of the consumer making the request. A controller shall not require a consumer to create a new account in order to exercise consumer rights pursuant to section 715D.3, but may require a consumer to use an existing account.

Sec. 5. NEW SECTION. 715D.5 Processor duties.

1. A processor shall assist a controller in duties required under this chapter, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as is reasonably practicable, as follows:  
a. To fulfill the controller's obligation to respond to consumer rights requests pursuant to section 715D.3.  
b. To meet the controller's obligations in relation to the security of processing the personal data and in relation to the notification of a security breach of the processor pursuant to section 715C.2.  
2. A contract between a controller and a processor shall govern the processor's data processing procedures with respect to processing performed on behalf of the controller. The contract shall clearly set forth instructions for processing personal data, the nature and purpose of processing, the type of data subject to processing, the duration of processing, and the rights and duties of both parties. The contract shall also include requirements that the processor shall do all of the following:  
a. Ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of confidentiality with respect to the data.  
b. At the controller's direction, delete or return all personal data to the controller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal data is required by law.

c. Upon the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the controller all information in the processor's possession necessary to demonstrate the processor's compliance with the obligations in this chapter.

d. Engage any subcontractor or agent pursuant to a written contract in accordance with this section that requires the subcontractor to meet the duties of the processor with respect to the personal data.

3. Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve a controller or a processor from imposed liabilities by virtue of the controller or processor's role in the processing relationship as defined by this chapter.

4. Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that depends upon the context in which personal data is to be processed. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor.

Sec. 6. NEW SECTION. 715D.6 Processing data — exemptions.

1. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require the following:

a. A controller or processor to re-identify de-identified data or pseudonymous data.

a. The controller is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the personal data or it would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate the request with the personal data.

b. The controller does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the specific consumer who is the subject of the personal data, or associate the personal data with other personal data about the same specific consumer.

c. The controller does not sell the personal data to any third party or otherwise voluntarily disclose the personal data to any third party other than a processor, except as otherwise permitted in this chapter.

3. Consumer rights contained in sections 715D.3 and 715D.4 shall not apply to pseudonymous data in cases where the controller is able to demonstrate any information necessary to identify the consumer is kept separately and is subject to appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data is not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.

4. Controllers that disclose pseudonymous data or de-identified data shall exercise reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with any contractual commitments to which the pseudonymous data or de-identified data is subject and shall take appropriate steps to address any breaches of those contractual commitments.

Sec. 7. NEW SECTION. 715D.7 Limitations.

1. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict a controller's or processor's ability to do the following:

a. Comply with federal, state, or local laws, rules, or regulations.

f. Take immediate steps to protect an interest that is essential for the life or physical safety of the consumer or

(1) If the deletion of the information is likely to provide substantial benefits that do not exclusively accrue to the controller.

(2) The expected benefits of the research outweigh the privacy risks.

(3) If the controller has implemented reasonable safeguards to mitigate privacy risks associated with research, including any risks associated with re-identification.

$k$ . Assist another controller, processor, or third party with any of the obligations under this subsection.

2. The obligations imposed on a controller or processor under this chapter shall not restrict a controller's or processor's ability to collect, use, or retain data as follows:

a. To conduct internal research to develop, improve, or repair products, services, or technology.

b. To effectuate a product recall.

c. To identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended functionality.

d. To perform internal operations that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the consumer or reasonably anticipated based on the consumer's existing relationship with the controller or are otherwise compatible with processing data in furtherance of the provision of a product or service specifically requested by a consumer or parent or guardian of a child or the performance of a contract to which the consumer or

parent or guardian of a child is a party.

3. The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this chapter shall not apply where compliance by the controller or processor with this chapter would violate an evidentiary privilege under the laws of the state. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent a controller or processor from providing personal data concerning a consumer to a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under the laws of the state as part of a privileged communication.  
4. A controller or processor that discloses personal data to a third-party controller or processor, in compliance with the requirements of this chapter, is not in violation of this chapter if the third-party controller or processor that receives and processes such personal data is in violation of this chapter, provided that, at the time of disclosing the personal data, the disclosing controller or processor did not have actual knowledge that the recipient intended to commit a violation. A third-party controller or processor receiving personal data from a controller or processor in compliance with the requirements of this chapter is likewise not in violation of this chapter for the offenses of the controller or processor from which it receives such personal data.  
5. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as an obligation imposed on a controller or a processor that adversely affects the privacy or other rights or freedoms of any persons, such as exercising the right of free speech pursuant to the first amendment to the United States Constitution, or applies to personal data by a person in the course of a purely personal or household activity.  
6. Personal data processed by a controller pursuant to this section shall not be processed for any purpose other than those expressly listed in this section unless otherwise allowed by this chapter. Personal data processed by a controller pursuant to this section may be processed to the extent that such processing is as follows:  
a. Reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes listed in this section.  
b. Adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the specific purposes listed in this section.

Personal data collected, used, or retained pursuant to this section shall, where applicable, take into account the nature and purpose or purposes of such collection, use, or retention. Such data shall be subject to reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of the personal data.

7. If a controller processes personal data pursuant to an exemption in this section, the controller bears the burden of demonstrating that such processing qualifies for the exemption and complies with the requirements in subsection 6.  
8. Processing personal data for the purposes expressly identified in subsection 1 shall not in and of itself make an entity a controller with respect to such processing.  
9. This chapter shall not require a controller, processor, third party, or consumer to disclose trade secrets.

Sec. 8. NEW SECTION. 715D.8 Enforcement — penalties.

1. The attorney general shall have exclusive authority to enforce the provisions of this chapter.

3. If a controller or processor continues to violate this chapter following the cure period in subsection 2 or breaches an express written statement provided to the attorney general under that subsection, the attorney general may initiate an

action in the name of the state and may seek an injunction to restrain any violations of this chapter and civil penalties of up to seven thousand five hundred dollars for each violation under this chapter. Any moneys collected under this section including civil penalties, costs, attorney fees, or amounts which are specifically directed shall be paid into the consumer education and litigation fund established under section 714.16C.
