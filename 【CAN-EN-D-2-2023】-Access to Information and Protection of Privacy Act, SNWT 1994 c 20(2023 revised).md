Effect of failure to respond

(2) The failure of a head to respond to a request in time is deemed to be a decision to refuse access to the record. SNWT 2003,c.19,s.2; SNWT 2019,c.8,s.6.

9. (1) Subject to subsection (2), the applicant must be told, in a response under subsection 8(1),

Copy of record to be provided with response

Extension of time limit for responding

11. (1) The head of a public body may extend the time for responding to a request for a period not exceeding 20 business days where

(a) the applicant does not give enough detail to enable the public body to identify a requested record;  
(b) a large number of records is requested or must be searched to identify the requested record and meeting the time limit would unreasonably interfere with the operations of the public body;

third party or another public body before the head can decide whether or not the applicant is entitled under this Act to access to a requested record; or

(d) a third party asks for a review under subsection 28(2).

Notifying applicant of extension

(2) Where the time for responding to a request is extended under subsection (1), the head of the public body must tell the applicant without delay

Request in writing and timing

(2) A request under subsection (1) must be made in writing to the Information and Privacy Commissioner as soon as reasonably possible and before the expiration of the time limit for the extension under subsection 11(1).

Suspension of time limit

(3) If the head of a public body requests the Information and Privacy Commissioner to authorize a further extension of the time limit for responding to a request, the time limits under subsection 11(1) for the head of a public body to respond to an applicant are suspended from the day the head of the public body makes the request to the day the head of the public body receives the decision from the Information and Privacy Commissioner.
