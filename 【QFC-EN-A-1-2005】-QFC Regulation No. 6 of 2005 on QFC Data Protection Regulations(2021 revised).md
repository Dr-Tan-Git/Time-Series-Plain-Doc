In this case, these Regulations apply only to the extent of that Processing activity.

# PART 2 - GENERAL PROVISIONS FOR THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA

# ARTICLE 8 - PRINCIPLES RELATING TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA

(1) Principle 1: Lawfulness, fairness and transparency

Personal Data of a Data Subject must be Processed lawfully, fairly and transparently.

(2) Principle 2: Specific purpose

A Data Processor must not further Process Personal Data in a way that is incompatible with those purposes or those rights.

(3) Principle 3: Data minimisation

Personal Data that is Processed must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are Processed.

(4) Principle 4: Accuracy

Personal Data may be Processed only if the data are accurate and up to date. Reasonable efforts (taking into account the purposes for which the data were Processed) must be made to ensure that Personal Data that are inaccurate are erased or corrected without undue delay.

(5) Principle 5: Storage limitation

Personal Data must be kept in a form that permits Data Subjects to be identified but only for as long as is necessary for the purposes for which the data were Processed.

(6) Principle 6: Integrity and confidentiality of Processing

Personal Data must be Processed in a way that ensures that the data are appropriately secure, using appropriate technical and organisational measures. In particular, the data must be protected against unauthorised or unlawful Processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.

# ARTICLE 9 - RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLES

A Data Controller must be able to demonstrate that it complies with the principles in Article 8.

# ARTICLE 10 - LAWFULNESS OF PROCESSING

(B) the Processing is necessary for substantial public interest reasons, on the basis of applicable laws and regulations, that are proportionate to the aim or aims pursued, respect the principles of data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights of the Data Subject.

# ARTICLE 23 - TRANSFERS OUT OF THE QFC: ADEQUATE LEVEL OF PROTECTION

(1) Any Processing of Personal Data which involves the transfer of Personal Data to a Recipient located in a jurisdiction outside the QFC may take place if the Data Protection Office has decided that the jurisdiction has an adequate level of protection.  
(2) For the purposes of the decision required by paragraph (1), the Data Protection Office may take into account factors including:

(A) the rule of law, the general respect for individual's rights and the ability of individuals to enforce their rights via administrative or judicial redress;  
(B) the access of public authorities to Personal Data;  
(C) the existence of effective data protection law, including rules on the onward transfer of Personal Data to another jurisdiction;  
(D) the existence and functioning of one or more independent supervisory authorities with adequate enforcement powers; and  
(E) international commitments and conventions binding on the jurisdiction and its membership of any multilateral or regional organisations.

(3) The Data Protection Office may make its decision based on adequacy decisions made by other competent data protection authorities where those decisions have taken into account the same factors.  
(4) The Data Protection Office must publish details of its decisions under paragraph (2).  
(5) A jurisdiction may lose adequacy status from time to time. In such circumstances, the Data Protection Office will issue an amended list of jurisdictions.  
(6) Processing of Personal Data that involves the transfer of the Personal Data to a Recipient located in a jurisdiction outside the QFC that the Data Protection Office has decided has an adequate level of protection does not require any specific authorisation or notification to the Data Protection Office.

# ARTICLE 24 - TRANSFERS OUT OF THE QFC IN THE ABSENCE OF AN ADEQUATE LEVEL OF PROTECTION

(1) A transfer of Personal Data to a Recipient located in a jurisdiction outside the QFC, if that jurisdiction has not been decided to have an adequate level of protection in accordance with Article 23, may take place only if:

(A) the Data Controller or Data Processor in question has provided appropriate safeguards including enforceable rights and effective legal remedies for Data Subjects;  
(B) one of the specific derogations in paragraph (3) applies; or  
(C) the limited circumstances in paragraph (4) apply.

(2) The appropriate safeguards referred to in paragraph (1)(A) may be provided by:

(A) a legally binding and enforceable arrangement between public authorities or bodies; or  
(B) a legally binding and enforceable agreement between the parties that includes standard data protection clauses adopted by the Data Protection Office.

(A) the Data Subject concerned has been informed of the risks and has given their explicit consent to the transfer of their Personal Data for one or more specific purposes;  
(B) the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the Data Subject and the Data Controller or the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at the Data Subject's request;

(c) the Civil and Commercial Court;  
(d) the Regulatory Tribunal;

(A) the transfer:

(i) is not repeating or not part of a repetitive course of transfers;  
(ii) concerns only a limited number of Data Subjects;  
(iii) does not contain any Sensitive Personal Data;
