(b) Each controller that conducts a data protection assessment pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall: (1) Review such data protection assessment as necessary to account for any material change to the processing operations of the online service, product or feature that is the subject of such data protection assessment; and (2) maintain documentation concerning such data protection assessment for the longer of (A) the three-year period beginning on the date on which such processing operations cease, or (B) as long as such controller offers such online service, product or feature.  
(c) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of processing operations that include similar activities.  
(d) If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose of complying with another applicable law or regulation, the data protection assessment shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements established in this section if such data protection assessment is reasonably similar in scope and effect to the data protection assessment

# Substitute Senate Bill No. 3

that would otherwise be conducted pursuant to this section.

(e) If any controller conducts a data protection assessment pursuant to subsection (a) of this section and determines that the online service, product or feature that is the subject of such assessment poses a heightened risk of harm to minors, such controller shall establish and implement a plan to mitigate or eliminate such risk.

(f) Data protection assessments shall be confidential and shall be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, as defined in section 1-200 of the general statutes. To the extent any information contained in a data protection assessment disclosed to the Attorney General includes information subject to the attorney-client privilege or work product protection, such disclosure shall not constitute a waiver of such privilege or protection.

Sec. 11. (NEW) (Effective October 1, 2024) (a) A processor shall adhere to the instructions of a controller, and shall: (1) Assist the controller in meeting the controller's obligations under sections 8 to 13, inclusive, of this act taking into account (A) the nature of the processing, (B) the information available to the processor by appropriate technical and organizational measures, and (C) whether such assistance is reasonably practicable and necessary to assist the controller in meeting such obligations; and (2) provide any information that is necessary to enable the controller to conduct and document data protection assessments.

# Substitute Senate Bill No. 3

(d) Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that depends upon the context in which personal data is to be processed. A person who is not limited in such person's processing of personal data pursuant to a controller's instructions, or who fails to adhere to such instructions, is a controller and not a processor with respect to a specific processing of data. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor. If a processor begins, alone or jointly with others, determining the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, the processor is a controller with respect to such processing and may be subject to an enforcement action under section 13 of this act.

(NEW) (Effective October 1, 2024) (a) The provisions of sections 8 to 11, inclusive, and section 13 of this act shall not apply to any: (1) Body, authority, board, bureau, commission, district or agency of this state or of any political subdivision of this state; (2) organization that is exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(3), 501(c)(4), 501(c)(6) or 501(c)(12) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as amended from time to time; (3) individual who, or school, board, association, limited liability company or corporation that, is licensed or accredited to offer one or more programs of higher learning leading to one or more degrees; (4) national securities association that is registered under 15 USC 78o-3, as amended from time to time; (5) financial institution or data that is subject to Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, 15 USC 6801 et seq., as amended from time to time; (6) covered entity or business associate, as defined in 45 CFR 160.103, as amended from time to time; (7) tribal nation government organization; or (8) air carrier, as defined in 49 USC 40102, as amended from time to time, and regulated under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, 49 USC 40101 et seq., and the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, 49 USC 41713, as said acts may be amended
