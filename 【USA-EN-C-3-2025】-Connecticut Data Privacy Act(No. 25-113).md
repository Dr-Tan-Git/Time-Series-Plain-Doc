A controller shall not discriminate against a consumer for exercising any of the consumer rights contained in sections 42-515 to 42-525, inclusive, as amended by this act, including denying goods or services, charging different prices or rates for goods or services or providing a different level of quality of goods or services to the consumer.

[(b)] (2) Nothing in subdivision (1) of this subsection [(a) of this section] shall be construed to require a controller to provide a product or service that requires the personal data of a consumer which the controller does not collect or maintain, or prohibit a controller from offering a different price, rate, level, quality or selection of goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods or services for no fee, if the offering is in connection with a consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts or club card program.

[(c)] (b) (1) A controller shall provide consumers with a reasonably

# Substitute Senate Bill No. 1295

accessible, clear and meaningful privacy notice that includes: [(1)] (A) The categories of personal data processed by the controller; [(2)] (B) the purpose for processing personal data; [(3) how consumers may exercise their consumer rights, including how a consumer may appeal a controller's decision] (C) a description of the means, established pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, for consumers to submit requests to exercise their consumer rights pursuant to sections 42-515 to 42-525, inclusive, as amended by this act, including, but not limited to, a description of (i) how consumers may exercise their consumer rights under subsection (a) of section 42-518, as amended by this act, and (ii) how consumers may appeal controllers' decisions with regard to [the consumer's request; (4)] requests to exercise such rights; (D) the categories of personal data that the controller [shares with] sells to third parties, if any; [(5)] (E) the categories of third parties, if any, [with] to which the controller [shares] sells personal data; [and (6)] (F) a clear and conspicuous disclosure of (i) any processing of personal data for purposes of targeted advertising, or (ii) any sale of personal data to a third party for purposes of targeted advertising; (G) an active electronic mail address or other online mechanism that [the consumer] consumers may use to contact the controller; (H) a statement disclosing whether the controller collects, uses or sells personal data for the purpose of training large language models; and (I) the most recent month and year during which the controller updated such privacy notice.

(2) A controller shall make the privacy notice required under subdivision (1) of this subsection publicly available: (A) Through a conspicuous hyperlink that includes the word "privacy" (i) on the home page of the controller's Internet web site, if the controller maintains an Internet web site, (ii) on the application store page or download page of a mobile device, if the controller maintains an application for use on a mobile device, and (iii) on the application's settings menu or in a similarly conspicuous and accessible location, if the controller maintains an application for use on a mobile device or other device used to connect

# Substitute Senate Bill No. 1295

to the Internet; (B) through a medium in which the controller regularly interacts with consumers, including, but not limited to, mail, if the controller does not maintain an Internet web site; (C) in each language in which the controller (i) provides any product or service that is subject to the privacy notice, or (ii) carries out any activity that is related to any product or service described in subparagraph (C)(i) of this subdivision; and (D) in a manner that is reasonably accessible to, and usable by, individuals with disabilities.

(3) Whenever a controller makes any retroactive material change to the controller's privacy notice or practices, the controller shall: (A) Notify the consumers affected by such material change with respect to any personal data to be collected after the effective date of such material change; and (B) provide a reasonable opportunity for the consumers described in subparagraph (A) of this subdivision to withdraw consent to any further and materially different collection, processing or transfer of previously collected personal data following such material change. The controller shall take all reasonable electronic measures to provide such notice to such affected consumers, taking into account the technology available to the controller and the nature of the controller's relationship with such affected consumers.  
(4) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require a controller to provide a privacy notice that is specific to this state if the controller provides a generally applicable privacy notice that satisfies the requirements established in this subsection.  
[(d) If a controller sells personal data to third parties or processes personal data for targeted advertising, the controller shall clearly and conspicuously disclose such processing, as well as the manner in which a consumer may exercise the right to opt out of such processing.]  
[(e)] (c) (1) A controller shall establish [, and shall describe in a privacy notice,] one or more secure and reliable means for consumers to

# Substitute Senate Bill No. 1295

submit a request to exercise their consumer rights pursuant to sections 42-515 to 42-525, inclusive, as amended by this act. Such means shall take into account the ways in which consumers normally interact with the controller, the need for secure and reliable communication of such requests and the ability of the controller to verify the identity of the consumer making the request. A controller shall not require a consumer to create a new account in order to exercise consumer rights, but may require a consumer to use an existing account. Any such means shall include:

(A) (i) Providing a clear and conspicuous [link] [hyperlink] on the controller's Internet web site to an Internet web page that enables [a] the consumer, or an agent of the consumer, to opt out of the processing of the consumer's personal data for purposes of targeted advertising or any sale of the consumer's personal data; and  
(ii) [Not later than January 1, 2025, allowing] Allowing a consumer to opt out of any processing of the consumer's personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, or any sale of such personal data, through an opt-out preference signal sent, with such consumer's consent, by a platform, technology or mechanism to the controller indicating such consumer's intent to opt out of any such processing or sale. Such platform, technology or mechanism shall:  
(I) Not unfairly disadvantage another controller;  
(II) Not make use of a default setting, but, rather, require the consumer to make an affirmative, freely given and unambiguous choice to opt out of any processing of such consumer's personal data pursuant to sections 42-515 to 42-525, inclusive, as amended by this act;  
(III) Be consumer-friendly and easy to use by the average consumer;  
(IV) Be as consistent as possible with any other similar platform, technology or mechanism required by any federal or state law or

# Substitute Senate Bill No. 1295

regulation; and

(V) Enable the controller to accurately determine whether the consumer is a resident of this state and whether the consumer has made a legitimate request to opt out of any sale of such consumer's personal data or targeted advertising.

(B) If a consumer's decision to opt out of any processing of the consumer's personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, or any sale of such personal data, through an opt-out preference signal sent in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (A) of this subdivision conflicts with the consumer's existing controller-specific privacy setting or voluntary participation in a controller's bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts or club card program, the controller shall comply with such consumer's opt-out preference signal but may notify such consumer of such conflict and provide to such consumer the choice to confirm such controller-specific privacy setting or participation in such program.

(2) If a controller responds to consumer opt-out requests received pursuant to subparagraph (A) of subdivision (1) of this subsection by informing the consumer of a charge for the use of any product or service, the controller shall present the terms of any financial incentive offered pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection [(b)] (a) of this section for the retention, use, sale or sharing of the consumer's personal data.

Sec. 10. Section 42-521 of the general statutes is repealed and the following is substituted in lieu thereof (Effective July 1, 2026):

(a) A processor shall adhere to the instructions of a controller and shall assist the controller in meeting the controller's obligations under sections 42-515 to 42-525, inclusive, as amended by this act. Such assistance shall include: (1) Taking into account the nature of processing and [the information available to the processor, by appropriate technical

# Substitute Senate Bill No. 1295

and organizational measures,] insofar as is [reasonably practicable] possible, to fulfill the controller's obligation to respond to [consumer rights requests] consumers' requests to exercise their rights under section 42-518, as amended by this act; (2) taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor, by assisting the controller in meeting the controller's obligations in relation to the security of processing the personal data and in relation to the notification of a breach of security, as defined in section 36a-701b, of the system of the processor, in order to meet the controller's obligations; and (3) providing necessary information to enable the controller to conduct and document data protection assessments and impact assessments.

(b) A contract between a controller and a processor shall govern the processor's data processing procedures with respect to processing performed on behalf of the controller. The contract shall be binding and clearly set forth instructions for processing data, the nature and purpose of processing, the type of data subject to processing, the duration of processing and the rights and obligations of both parties. The contract shall also require that the processor: (1) Ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of confidentiality with respect to the data; (2) at the controller's direction, delete or return all personal data to the controller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal data is required by law; (3) upon the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the controller all information in its possession necessary to demonstrate the processor's compliance with the obligations in sections 42-515 to 42-525, inclusive, as amended by this act; (4) after providing the controller an opportunity to object, engage any subcontractor pursuant to a written contract that requires the subcontractor to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data; and (5) allow, and cooperate with, reasonable assessments by the controller or the controller's designated assessor, or the processor may arrange for a qualified and independent assessor to conduct an assessment of the processor's

# Substitute Senate Bill No. 1295

policies and technical and organizational measures in support of the obligations under sections 42-515 to 42-525, inclusive, as amended by this act, using an appropriate and accepted control standard or framework and assessment procedure for such assessments. The processor shall provide a report of such assessment to the controller upon request.

(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve a controller or processor from the liabilities imposed on the controller or processor by virtue of such controller's or processor's role in the processing relationship, as described in sections 42-515 to 42-525, inclusive, as amended by this act.

(d) Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that depends upon the context in which personal data [is] are to be processed. A person who is not limited in such person's processing of personal data pursuant to a controller's instructions, or who fails to adhere to such instructions, is a controller and not a processor with respect to a specific processing of data. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor. If a processor begins, alone or jointly with others, determining the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, the processor is a controller with respect to such processing and may be subject to an enforcement action under section 42-525.

Sec. 11. Section 42-522 of the general statutes is repealed and the following is substituted in lieu thereof (Effective July 1, 2026):

(a) For the purposes of this section, processing that presents a heightened risk of harm to a consumer includes: (1) The processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising; (2) the sale of personal data; (3) the processing of personal data for the purposes of

# Substitute Senate Bill No. 1295

profiling, where such profiling presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of (A) unfair or deceptive treatment of, or unlawful disparate impact on, consumers, (B) financial, physical or reputational injury to consumers, (C) a physical or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the private affairs or concerns, of consumers, where such intrusion would be offensive to a reasonable person, or (D) other substantial injury to consumers; and (4) the processing of sensitive data.

[(a)] (b) (1) A controller shall conduct and document a data protection assessment for each of the controller's processing activities that presents a heightened risk of harm to a consumer. [For the purposes of this section, processing that presents a heightened risk of harm to a consumer includes: (1) The processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising; (2) the sale of personal data; (3) the processing of personal data for the purposes of profiling, where such profiling presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of (A) unfair or deceptive treatment of, or unlawful disparate impact on, consumers, (B) financial, physical or reputational injury to consumers, (C) a physical or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the private affairs or concerns, of consumers, where such intrusion would be offensive to a reasonable person, or (D) other substantial injury to consumers; and (4) the processing of sensitive data.]

[(b) Data protection assessments] (2) Each data protection assessment conducted pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection [(a) of this section] shall identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and indirectly, from the processing to the controller, the consumer, other stakeholders and the public against the potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with such processing, as mitigated by safeguards that can be employed by the controller to reduce such risks. The controller shall factor into [any] each such data protection assessment the use of de-identified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well as the context of the processing and the

# Substitute Senate Bill No. 1295

relationship between the controller and the consumer whose personal data will be processed.

(c) Each controller that engages in any profiling for the purposes of making a decision that produces any legal or similarly significant effect concerning a consumer shall conduct an impact assessment for such profiling. Such impact assessment shall include, to the extent reasonably known by or available to the controller, as applicable: (1) A statement by the controller disclosing the purpose, intended use cases and deployment context of, and benefits afforded by, such profiling; (2) an analysis of whether such profiling poses any known or reasonably foreseeable heightened risk of harm to a consumer, and, if so, (A) the nature of such heightened risk of harm to a consumer, and (B) the steps that have been taken to mitigate such heightened risk of harm to a consumer; (3) a description of (A) the main categories of personal data processed as inputs for the purposes of such profiling, and (B) the outputs such profiling produces; (4) an overview of the main categories of personal data the controller used to customize such profiling, if the controller used data to customize such profiling; (5) any metrics used to evaluate the performance and known limitations of such profiling; (6) a description of any transparency measures taken concerning such profiling, including, but not limited to, any measures taken to disclose to consumers that such controller is engaged in such profiling while such controller is engaged in such profiling; and (7) a description of the post-deployment monitoring and user safeguards provided concerning such profiling, including, but not limited to, the oversight, use and learning processes established by the controller to address issues arising from such profiling.

[(c)] (d) The Attorney General may require that a controller disclose any data protection assessment or impact assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the Attorney General, and the controller shall make the data protection assessment or impact assessment

# Substitute Senate Bill No. 1295

available to the Attorney General. The Attorney General may evaluate the data protection assessment or impact assessment for compliance with the responsibilities set forth in sections 42-515 to 42-525, inclusive<sub>z</sub> as amended by this act. Data protection assessments and impact assessments shall be confidential and shall be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, as defined in section 1-200. To the extent any information contained in a data protection assessment or impact assessment disclosed to the Attorney General includes information subject to attorney-client privilege or work product protection, such disclosure shall not constitute a waiver of such privilege or protection.

[(d)] (e) A single data protection assessment or impact assessment may address a comparable set of processing operations that include similar activities.  
[(e)] (f) If a controller conducts a data protection assessment or impact assessment for the purpose of complying with another applicable law or regulation, the data protection assessment or impact assessment shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements established in this section if such data protection assessment or impact assessment is reasonably similar in scope and effect to the data protection assessment or impact assessment that would otherwise be conducted pursuant to this section.  
[(f)]  $(\underline{\mathbf{g}})$  (1) Data protection assessment requirements shall apply to processing activities created or generated after July 1, 2023, and are not retroactive.  
(2) Impact assessment requirements shall apply to processing activities created or generated on or after August 1, 2026, and are not retroactive.

Sec. 12. Subsections (a) to (d), inclusive, of section 42-524 of the general statutes are repealed and the following are substituted in lieu

# Substitute Senate Bill No. 1295

thereof (Effective July 1, 2026):

# Substitute Senate Bill No. 1295

research, including any risks associated with re-identification; (11) assist another controller, processor, consumer health data controller or third party with any of the obligations under sections 42-515 to 42-526, inclusive, as amended by this act; or (12) process personal data for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, community health or population health, but solely to the extent that such processing is (A) subject to suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights of the consumer whose personal data [is] are being processed, and (B) under the responsibility of a professional subject to confidentiality obligations under federal, state or local law.

(b) The obligations imposed on controllers, processors or consumer health data controllers under sections 42-515 to 42-526, inclusive, as amended by this act, shall not restrict a controller's, processor's or consumer health data controller's ability to collect, use or retain data for internal use to: (1) Conduct internal research to develop, improve or repair products, services or technology; (2) effectuate a product recall; (3) identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended functionality; (4) process personal data for the purposes of profiling in furtherance of any automated decision that may produce any legal or similarly significant effect concerning a consumer, provided such personal data are (A) processed only to the extent necessary to detect or correct any bias that may result from processing such data for such purposes, such bias cannot effectively be detected or corrected without processing such data and such data are deleted once such processing has been completed, (B) processed subject to appropriate safeguards to protect the rights of consumers secured by the Constitution or laws of this state or of the United States, (C) subject to technical restrictions concerning the reuse of such data and industry-standard security and privacy measures, including, but not limited to, pseudonymization, (D) subject to measures to ensure that such data are secure, protected and subject to suitable safeguards, including, but not limited to, strict controls concerning, and documentation of, access to such data, to avoid

misuse and ensure that only authorized persons may access such data while preserving the confidentiality of such data, and (E) not transmitted, transferred or otherwise accessed by any third party; [or (4)] (5) perform internal operations that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the consumer or reasonably anticipated based on the consumer's existing relationship with the controller or consumer health data controller, or are otherwise compatible with processing data in furtherance of the provision of a product or service specifically requested by a consumer or the performance of a contract to which the consumer is a party; or (6) perform internal operations in accordance with the internal operations exception established in COPPA if the controller, processor or consumer health data controller is processing data in accordance with such exception.

(c) The obligations imposed on controllers, processors or consumer health data controllers under sections 42-515 to 42-526, inclusive, as amended by this act, shall not apply where compliance by the controller, processor or consumer health data controller with said sections would violate an evidentiary privilege under the laws of this state. Nothing in sections 42-515 to 42-526, inclusive, as amended by this act, shall be construed to prevent a controller, processor or consumer health data controller from providing personal data concerning a consumer to a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under the laws of the state as part of a privileged communication.

(d) A controller, processor or consumer health data controller that discloses personal data to a processor or third-party controller in accordance with sections 42-515 to 42-526, inclusive, as amended by this act, shall not be deemed to have violated said sections if the processor or third-party controller that receives and processes such personal data violates said sections, provided, at the time the disclosing controller, processor or consumer health data controller disclosed such personal data, the disclosing controller, processor or consumer health data

# Substitute Senate Bill No. 1295

controller did not have actual knowledge that the receiving processor or third-party controller would violate said sections. A third-party controller or processor receiving personal data from a controller, processor or consumer health data controller in compliance with sections 42-515 to 42-526, inclusive, as amended by this act, is likewise not in violation of said sections for the transgressions of the controller, processor or consumer health data controller from which such third-party controller or processor receives such personal data.

Sec. 13. Subsections (a) and (b) of section 42-528 of the general statutes are repealed and the following is substituted in lieu thereof (Effective July 1, 2026):

(a) For the purposes of this section:

(3) A social media platform shall establish, and shall describe in a privacy notice, one or more secure and reliable means for submitting a request pursuant to this subsection. A social media platform that provides a mechanism for a minor or, if the minor is younger than sixteen years of age, the minor's parent or legal guardian to initiate a process to delete or unpublish such minor's social media platform account shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions of this subsection.
