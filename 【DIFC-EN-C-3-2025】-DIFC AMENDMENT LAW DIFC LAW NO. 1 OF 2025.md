(2) A Title Transfer Financial Collateral Arrangement takes effect in accordance with its terms.

# 106. Security Financial Collateral Arrangements

(1) Subject to Article 106(2), a Security Right under a Security Financial Collateral Arrangement is created in relation to Financial Collateral upon satisfaction of Artiele-13.

(a) satisfaction of Article 13; and  
(2b) In relation to Financial Collateral, 'Possession' under Article 13(4) of the Law is to be construed as meaning Control when the Secured Creditor has Control of the Financial Collateral pursuant to the terms of that Security Financial Collateral Arrangement.

(2) Article 13(4) of the Law shall not apply to Security Agreements to Security Financial Collateral Arrangements, which must be evidenced by writing and is signed by the Grantor.  
(3) A Security Right in Financial Collateral may be granted on terms such that it extends to all Financial Collateral from time to time standing to the credit of one (1) or more accounts or to a specified category, quantity, proportion or value of such Financial Collateral. Such a Security Right is effective without the need for further identification of particular Financial Collateral.  
(4) Without prejudice to any other method by which a Security Right under a Security Financial Collateral Arrangement may be made is effective against third parties, this shall occur if the Secured Creditor has Control of the Financial Collateral pursuant to the terms of that Security Financial Collateral Arrangement upon satisfaction of Article 106(1).

(a) all Secured Obligations are discharged and there are no outstanding commitments to extend credit secured by the Security Financial Collateral Agreement;

(6) Subject to Article 107, a Secured Creditor taking a Security Financial Collateral Arrangement over Financial Collateral takes free of a pre-existing Security Right in the same collateral assets, even if the pre-existing Security Right were made effective against third parties in accordance with Part 3 of the Law and the Secured Creditor to the Security Financial Collateral Arrangement has Knowledge of its existence.  
(7) Article 106(6) is without prejudice to any rights of the Secured Creditor under the pre-existing Security Rights against the Debtor (including, without limitation, in the proceeds of the Financial Collateral received by the Debtor).

# 107. Priority of interests in the same FCR-ReeerableFinancial Collateral

(2) Notwithstanding Article 107(1), a Security Financial Collateral Arrangement pursuant to which the Secured Creditor has obtained Control over Financial Collateral by entry into a Control Agreement has priority over a subsequent Security Right in the same Financial Collateral in favour of the same Account Provider.

(e) in respect of Security Rights in Financial Property:

(i) if competing Security Rights have been made effective against third parties by registration of a notice in the Security Registry, Priority is determined by the order of registration, without regard to the order of creation of the Security Rights.  
(ii) if competing Security Rights have been made effective against third parties by entry into Control Agreements, Priority is determined by the order of conclusion of the Control Agreements.  
(iii) as between a Security Right made effective against third parties by Control and a Security Right made effective against third parties by registration of a notice in the Registry, the Security Right made effective against third parties by Control has Priority, unless the Secured Creditor with Control obtained Control with Knowledge that the taking of its Security Right violates the rights of a pre-existing Secured Creditor whose Security Right was made effective against third parties by registration of a notice in the Registry, in which case that pre-existing Security Right has Priority.

(iv) a Security Right of a Secured Creditor who is the Account Provider has Priority over a competing Security Right unless the competing Security Right is made effective against third parties by the non-Account Provider Secured Creditor being the Account Provider's customer in respect of the relevant Financial Property in the Financial Property Account, or the non-Account Provider Secured Creditor's entry into a Control Agreement in respect of the relevant Financial Property.  
(a) a Security Right made effective against third parties by a Secured Creditor being the Account Provider's customer in respect of the relevant Financial Property in the Financial Property Account has Priority over a Security Right made effective against third parties by a Secured Creditor entering a Control Agreement.

(d) in respect of Security Rights in a right to payment of Money credited to a Bank Account, Priority is determined by Article 107(1)(e) except that references to "Financial Property" are to be read as "Money credited to a Bank Account", and references to "Financial Property Account" are to be read as "Bank Account".  
(e) in respect of Security Rights in a FCR Receivable, Priority is determined by Article 107(1)(c)(i)-(iii), subject to the following:

(ii) a Security Right made effective against third parties by a Secured Creditor obtaining legal title in respect of the relevant FCR-Receivable has Priority over a Security Right made effective against third parties by a Secured Creditor entering a Control Agreement:

108. Security-Rights competing with rights of transferees-of-Financial Collateral[not used]

Subject to Article 59(2), a transferee of encumbered Financial Collateral acquires its rights free of the Security Right provided that the transferee gives value and does not have Knowledge that the transfer is in violation of the rights of the Secured Creditor under the Security Agreement.

109. Rights of Use, release of excess and substitution of Financial Collateral

(1) A Security Agreement may provide for the Secured Creditor to have a Right of Use in respect of Financial Collateral.  
(2) A Secured Creditor Collateral Taker has Control of Financial Collateral notwithstanding its exercise of a Right of Use.  
(3) The exercise of a Right of Use shall not render invalid or unenforceable any right of the Secured CreditorCollateral Taker under the relevant Financial Collateral Arrangement.

(a) has obtained title to Financial Collateral under a Title Transfer Financial Collateral Arrangement; or  
(b) exercises a Right of Use in respect of Financial Collateral pursuant to a Security Financial Collateral Arrangement,

it thereby incurs an obligation to replace the collateral originally transferred by transferring Equivalent Collateral to the Debtor no later than the discharge of the Secured Obligations.

(5) An obligation to transfer Equivalent Collateral under Article 109(4) is a "Redelivery Obligation".  
(6) A Secured-Creditor Collateral Taker has Control of Financial Collateral notwithstanding any provision in the terms of the Financial Collateral Arrangement which allows the Debtor to withdraw excess Financial Collateral or substitute Financial Collateral in accordance with the terms of such Financial Collateral Arrangement.

# 110. Enforcement of Financial Collateral Arrangements

(1) On the occurrence of an enforcement event specified under the terms of a Financial Collateral Arrangement, the Secured Creditor Collateral Taker may collect, enforce, dispose of or accept Financial Collateral:
