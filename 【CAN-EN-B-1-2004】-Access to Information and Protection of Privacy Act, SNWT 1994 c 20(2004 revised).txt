Information excepted from disclosure
(2) The right of access to a record does not extend to information excepted from disclosure under Division B of this Part, but where that information can reasonably be severed from a record, an applicant has a right of access to the remainder of the record.

Fees
(3) The right of access to a record is subject to the payment of any applicable fee.

6. (1) To obtain access to a record, a person must make a written request to the public body that the person believes has custody or control of the record.

Request to be detailed

(a) the time limit is extended under section 11; or
(b) the request has been transferred under section 12 to another public body.

Effect of failure to respond
(2) The failure of a head to respond to a request in time is deemed to be a decision to refuse access to the record. S.N.W.T. 2003,c.19,s.2.

Contents of response
9. (1) Subject to subsection (2), the applicant must be told, in a response under subsection 8(1),

Copy of record to be provided with response
(2) Where an applicant has asked for a copy of a record, the copy must be provided with the response or the applicant must be given reasons for the delay in providing the copy if
(a) the record, or the part of it to which access will be given, can be reasonably reproduced by the public body using its normal equipment and expertise; and
(b) creating the copy would not unreasonably interfere with the operations of the public body.

Examination of record
(3) Where an applicant has asked to examine a record or when a copy is not being provided under subsection (2), the applicant must
(a) be permitted to examine the record or part of the record; or
(b) be given access in accordance with the regulations.

Extension of time limit for responding
11. (1) The head of a public body may extend the time for responding to a request for a reasonable period where
(a) the applicant does not give enough detail to enable the public body to identify a requested record;
(b) a large number of records is requested or must be searched to identify the requested record and meeting the time limit would unreasonably interfere with the operations of the public body;
(c) more time is needed to consult with a third party or another public body before the head can decide whether or not the applicant is entitled under this Act to access to a requested record; or
(d) a third party asks for a review under subsection 28(2).
