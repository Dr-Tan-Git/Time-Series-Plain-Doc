(b) by depositing the written request or requirement (as the case may be) at the registered office or principal place of business of the data controller; or  
(c) by sending the written request or requirement (as the case may be) by registered post to the registered office or principal place of business of the data controller.

Response by data controller to request or requirement pursuant to sections 6(2), 11(1), 12(2), 12(3)(b) or 13(1) of the Act.

4.-(1) Where a data controller is informed that an individual who wishes to submit a written request, or requirement, to that data controller pursuant to sections 6(2), 11(1), 12(2), 12(3)(b) or 13(1) of the Act, is unable to do so because of

(a) the individual's inability, or limited ability, to read or write English; or  
(b) any disability or other condition that impairs the individual's ability to prepare the request or requirement (as the case may be) in writing,

the data controller shall provide such assistance as may be necessary for the individual to prepare the request or requirement (as the case maybe).

(2) The information provided by a data controller pursuant to sections 6(2), 11(1), 12(2), 12(3)(b) or 13(1) (as the case may be) of the Act shall—

(a) be in writing, using clear and plain language, in a form that is intelligible and concise; and  
(b) for the purposes of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, or section 7(2) of the Act, a requirement to supply information in intelligible form shall be taken to have been met, in respect of an individual who has a sensory impairment, if the information is supplied in a format that allows the individual to read or listen to the information.  
(3) Where a request is made to a data controller under section 6(2) of the Act, the data controller shall have a further period, not exceeding forty-five days from the end of the period of thirty days ("the initial period") provided for in section 6(4) of the Act, within which to respond to the request, if—  
(a) the request involves complexity due to the volume or nature of the data, and responding within the initial period would unreasonably interfere with the operations of the data controller;  
(b) having regard to the number of such requests received by the data controller, the data controller cannot reasonably be expected to be able to respond within the initial period; or  
(c) providing the information requires the data controller to consult with a third party and such consultation cannot practically be completed within the initial period.  
(4) Where a data controller intends to rely on paragraph (3) for an extension of the time within which to respond to a request, the data controller shall, in writing, before the end of the initial period inform the requesting party of the extension, the period of the extension and the reason for the extension.

(3) If the data controller is a public authority, a waiver under paragraph (2) shall only be granted if the data controller considers that it is fair and equitable to do so after considering whether the payment will cause financial hardship for the requesting party.  
(4) Except in any case where the applicable fees have been waived, the data controller is not obliged to provide information requested under section 6(2) of the Act until the applicable fees have been paid.

Delegation of right to give or withhold consent to processing of personal data. First Schedule, Form 1B.

(a) shall not act on the delegation; and  
(b) shall promptly in writing inform the data subject of the non-conformity, specifying the nature of the non-conformity.

Consent to direct marketing. First Schedule, Form 6.

(a) may be a member of the staff of the data controller or may be an agent employed on a contractual basis; and  
(b) shall, in the capacity of data protection officer, report to a person, or persons, at the senior management or executive management level within the data controller's organisational structure.

(2) Where a data controller appoints a data protection officer who resides outside of Jamaica, the data controller shall ensure that the data protection officer has a representative who—

(a) resides in Jamaica; and  
(b) is tasked with ensuring that the functions of the data protection officer are carried out in accordance with the Act.

(3) Subject to section 20(2) of the Act, a person who is appointed as a data protection officer for a data controller may be appointed as a data protection officer for another data controller only if—

(a) having regard to the size and organisational structure of each of the data controllers, the person will be easily accessible by each of the data controllers and be able to perform the functions, specified in section 20 of the Act, in respect of each of the data controllers; and  
(b) the appointment does not create any potential for conflict of interest as regards the functions of the data protection officer, in relation to the operations of any of those data controllers and, in particular, the compliance of each of those data controllers with the Act.

(3) For the purposes of paragraph (2), additional information submitted in respect of a report shall be submitted in the form of an additional report in accordance with the form set out as Form 7 of the First Schedule.  
(4) The notification made by a data controller pursuant to section 21(5) of the Act to a data subject whose personal data is affected by a contravention of any data protection standard or a security breach, shall be made within seventy-two hours after the data controller becomes aware of the contravention or breach (as the case may be) affecting that data and shall contain the particulars specified in paragraph (7).

(5) A notification pursuant to paragraph (4) shall be made by the data controller

(a) directly to the data subject by post, electronic mail, or any other form of written communication that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances; or  
(b) by indirect means in accordance with paragraph (6), if the notification cannot be given directly to the data subject in accordance with paragraph (a), because to do so would cause undue hardship to the data controller or because the data controller does not have the contact information for the data subject.

(6) An indirect notification for the purposes of paragraph (5)(b) may be given by any medium of communication to which the public has access or by any means by which the notification could reasonably be expected to reach the data subject concerned.  
(7) A notification pursuant to paragraph (4) shall, in clear and plain language—  
(a) describe the nature of the contravention or security breach (as the case may be), including

(i) the details of what happened;  
(ii) the date or dates on which the contravention or breach occurred, or, if a precise date is unknown, the approximate period during which the contravention or breach occurred;

in   
accordance

protection   
standard.

11. (1) For the purposes of section 22(6) of the Act, in determining what information to provide to a data subject who provides or authorises the provision of personal data to a data controller, the data controller shall have regard to whether the information is sufficient to enable the data subject to understand—

(a) the purposes for which the personal data will be processed;  
(b) the likely consequences of the processing;  
(c) the nature and extent of the processing; and  
(d) whether or not particular disclosures are likely as a result of the processing, and to envisage the general nature of those disclosures.

(2) Where a data controller intends to rely on the condition set out in section 23(1)(f) of the Act for the processing of personal data, the data controller shall make a written assessment, kept in a manner that it can be readily associated with the personal data concerned, that—

(a) identifies the legitimate interest being pursued by the data controller or third party to whom the data are disclosed;  
(b) states the rationale for regarding the processing to be necessary for the purposes of that legitimate interest; and
