# DATA PROTECTION REGULATIONS 2021

Regulations to make provision for the protection of personal data processed or controlled from within the Abu Dhabi Global Market.

Date of Enactment: 11 February 2021

The Board of Directors of the Abu Dhabi Global Market, in exercise of its powers under Article 6(1) of the Law No.4 of 2013 concerning the Abu Dhabi Global Market issued by His Highness the Ruler of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, enacts the following Regulations.

# PARTIGeneral provisions

# 1. Subject-matter and objectives

(1) The objects of these Regulations are:

(a) to promote the protection of individuals' Personal Data;  
(b) to recognise that the right to the protection of Personal Data is not an absolute right; it must be considered in relation to its function and balanced against other rights;  
(c) to provide the basis for consistent regulation and Processing of Personal Data within ADGM;  
(d) to promote lawful, fair and transparent Processing of Personal Data;  
(e) to establish the primary responsibility and liability of the Controller for any processing of personal data carried out by the Controller or on the Controller's behalf;  
(f) to facilitate the transfer of Personal Data across borders while ensuring that the rights of individuals are respected;  
(g) to provide a means for individuals to complain about an alleged infringement of their rights relating to their Personal Data and to receive an effective judicial remedy; and  
(h) to implement ADGM's international commitments in relation to the Processing of Personal Data.

# 2. Material scope

(1) These Regulations apply to the Processing of Personal Data wholly or partly by automated means and to the Processing other than by automated means of Personal Data which forms part of a Filing System or is intended to form part of a Filing System. Files or sets of files, as well as their cover pages, which are not structured according to specific criteria do not fall within the scope of these Regulations.

(2) These Regulations do not apply to the Processing of Personal Data:

(a) by a natural person for the purposes of purely personal or household activity; or  
(b) by public authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to national security.

# 3. Territorial scope

(1) These Regulations apply to the Processing of Personal Data in the context of the activities of an Establishment of a Controller or a Processor in ADGM, regardless of whether the Processing takes place in ADGM or not.  
(2) Where the Processor is Processing Personal Data for a Controller outside of ADGM, the Processor must comply with the requirements of these Regulations to the extent possible, taking into account whether the Controller is subject to similar obligations under the laws of its home jurisdiction.  
(3) These Regulations apply to natural persons whatever their nationality or place of residence.

# PART II Principles

# 4. Principles relating to Processing of Personal Data

(1) Personal Data must be:

(a) Processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the Data Subject;  
(b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further Processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes;  
(c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are Processed;  
(d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that Personal Data that is inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are Processed, is erased or rectified without delay;  
(e) kept in a form which permits identification of Data Subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the Personal Data is Processed; and  
(f) Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the Personal Data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful Processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.

(2) The Controller is responsible for, and must be able to demonstrate compliance with, section 4(1).  
(3) Where Personal Data is Processed for Archiving and Research Purposes;

(a) this Processing is deemed to be compatible with the initial purposes for which the Personal Data was collected as required by section 4(1)(b); and  
(b) it may be stored for longer periods than stated in section 4(1)(e) provided appropriate technical and organisational measures are used to safeguard the rights of the Data Subject.

# 5. Lawfulness of Processing

(1) Processing is lawful only if and to the extent that:

(a) the Data Subject has given Consent to the Processing of their Personal Data for one or more specific purposes;  
(b) Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the Data Subject is a party or in order to take steps at the request of the Data Subject prior to entering into a contract;  
(c) Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Controller is subject under Applicable Law;

(d) Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the Data Subject or of another natural person;  
(e) Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out by a public authority in the interests of ADGM, or in the exercise of (i) ADGM's; (ii) the Financial Services Regulatory Authority's; (iii) the ADGM Court's; or (iv) the Registration Authority's functions or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Controller under Applicable Law; or  
(f) Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Controller or by a Third Party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or rights of the Data Subject which require protection of Personal Data, in particular where the Data Subject is a Child.

(2) Section 5(1)(f) does not apply if Processing is necessary for any of the purposes described in section 5(1)(e).  
(3) For the purposes of section 4(1)(b) the Controller must, in order to ascertain whether Processing for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the Personal Data is initially collected, take into account:

(a) any link between the purposes for which the Personal Data has been collected and the purposes of the intended further Processing;  
(b) the context in which the Personal Data has been collected, in particular the relationship between Data Subjects and the Controller;  
(c) the nature of the Personal Data, in particular whether Special Categories of Personal Data are Processed, pursuant to section 7;  
(d) the possible consequences of the intended further Processing for Data Subjects; and  
(e) the existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include encryption or Pseudonymisation.

# 6. Conditions for Consent

(1) Consent means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the Data Subject's wishes by which they (whether in writing, electronically or orally), by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signify agreement to the Processing of Personal Data relating to them.  
(2) Silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity do not constitute Consent.  
(3) For Consent to be informed, the Data Subject should be aware at least of the identity of the Controller and the purposes for which it is intended the Personal Data will be Processed.  
(4) Where Processing is based on Consent, the Controller must be able to demonstrate that the Data Subject has consented to Processing of their Personal Data.

(5) If the Data Subject's Consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the request for Consent must be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.  
(6) Any part of such a declaration which constitutes a contravention of these Regulations will not be binding.  
(7) The Data Subject has the right to withdraw their Consent at any time. The withdrawal of Consent will not affect the lawfulness of Processing based on Consent before its withdrawal. The Data Subject must be informed of this before giving Consent.  
(8) It must be as easy to withdraw Consent as it is to give Consent.  
(9) When assessing if Consent is freely given the assessor must take into account whether:

(a) the Data Subject has a genuine or free choice or is unable to refuse or withdraw Consent without detriment; and  
(b) the performance of a contract is conditional on Consent to the Processing of Personal Data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.

# 7. Processing of Special Categories of Personal Data

(1) Processing of:

(a) Personal Data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs;  
(b) Genetic Data, Biometric Data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, Data Concerning Health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation; and  
(c) Personal Data relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures,

(c) Processing is necessary to protect vital interests of the Data Subject or of another natural person where the Data Subject is physically or legally incapable of giving Consent;

(d) Processing is necessary for health purposes, including preventative or occupational medicine, the assessment of the working capacity of an employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health care or treatment or the management of health care systems or services or pursuant to a contract with a health professional provided that Processing is by or under the responsibility of a health professional subject to the obligation of professional secrecy or duty of confidentiality;  
(e) Processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, such as protecting against serious threats to health or ensuring high standards of quality and safety of health care and of medicinal products or medical devices;  
(f) Processing is necessary for Archiving and Research Purposes in accordance with Applicable Law;  
(g) Processing is carried out in the course of its legitimate activities with appropriate safeguards by a foundation, association or any other not-for-profit body including religious, cultural, educational, social or fraternal purposes or for other charitable purposes and on condition that the Processing relates solely to the members or to former members of the body or to persons who have regular contact with it in connection with its purposes and that the Personal Data is not disclosed outside that body without the Consent of the Data Subjects;

(k) Processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, provided that (unless specified otherwise) the Controller has, when the Processing is carried out, an appropriate policy document in place in accordance with section 7(3), where it is necessary for:

(i) the exercise of a function or requirement conferred on a person by Applicable Law;  
(ii) the exercise of a function of the Board, Abu Dhabi or United Arab Emirate government;  
(iii) the administration of justice;  
(iv) equality of opportunity or treatment provided that the Processing does not, or is not likely to, cause substantial damage or substantial distress to an individual; and it does not relate to an individual who has given written notice to the Controller not to Process their Personal Data;

(v) diversity at senior levels of organisations, where the Controller cannot reasonably be expected to obtain the Consent of the Data Subject and is not aware of the Data Subject withholding Consent provided that the Processing does not, or is not likely to, cause substantial damage or substantial distress to an individual;  
(vi) the prevention or detection of an unlawful act or omission where the Processing must be carried out without the Consent of the Data Subject so as not to prejudice this purpose; and if the Processing relates to the disclosure of Personal Data to a relevant public authority an appropriate policy document in accordance with section 7(3) need not be in place for the Processing to be lawful under these Regulations;  
(vii) the protection of the members of the public against dishonesty, malpractice or other seriously improper conduct, unfitness or incompetence, mismanagement in the administration of a company, body or association, or failures in services provided by a company, body or association where the Processing must be carried out without the Consent of the Data Subject so as not to prejudice this purpose;  
(viii) compliance with, or assisting other persons to comply with, a regulatory requirement which involves a person taking steps to establish whether another person has committed an unlawful act or omission, or been involved in dishonesty, malpractice or other seriously improper conduct where the Controller cannot reasonably be expected to obtain the Consent of the Data Subject to the Processing;

(3) Where it is specified that a condition in section 7(2) is met only if the Controller has an appropriate policy document in place, the Controller will have an appropriate policy document in place if:

(a) the policy document (which may incorporate other documents by reference) explains, for Personal Data Processed in reliance on the condition:

(i) how the Controller will comply with the principles in section 4; and  
(ii) the Controller's policies regarding the retention and erasure of that Personal Data; and

(b) from the date the Controller starts to Process Personal Data in reliance on the condition until 6 months after the Controller ceases to carry out such Processing, the policy document referred to in section 7(3)(a) is:

(i) retained, reviewed and updated (as appropriate); and  
(ii) made available to the Commissioner of Data Protection on request.

# 8. Processing which does not require identification

(1) If the purposes for which a Controller Processes Personal Data do not or no longer require the identification of a Data Subject by the Controller, the Controller is not obliged to maintain, acquire or Process additional information in order to identify the Data Subject for the sole purpose of complying with these Regulations.  
(2) Where, in cases referred to in section 8(1), the Controller is able to demonstrate that it is not in a position to identify the Data Subject, the Controller must inform the Data Subject accordingly, if possible.  
(3) In such cases, sections 13 to 18 will not apply except where the Data Subject, for the purpose of exercising their rights under those sections, provides additional information enabling their identification.

# 9. Processing for Archiving and Research Purposes

(b) the Processing must not cause, or be likely to cause, substantial damage or substantial distress to a Data Subject; and  
(c) the Processing must not be carried out for the purposes of measures or decisions with respect to a particular Data Subject, unless the purposes for which the Processing is necessary include the purpose of medical research that has been approved by a public authority or research institution.

# PART III Rights of the Data Subject

# 10. Transparent information, communication and modalities for the exercise of the rights of the Data Subject

(1) The Controller must take appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in sections 11 and 12 and any communication under sections 13 to 20 and section 32 relating to Processing to the Data Subject:

(a) in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, in particular for any information addressed specifically to a Child; and  
(b) in writing, electronically or, if requested by the Data Subject, orally as long as that Data Subject has provided proof of their identity.

(2) The Controller must facilitate the exercise of Data Subject rights under sections 13 to 20. In the cases referred to in section 8(3), the Controller must not refuse to act on the request of the Data Subject to exercise their rights under sections 13 to 20, unless the Controller demonstrates that it is not in a position to identify the Data Subject.  
(3) Subject to section 10(4), the Controller must provide information on action taken on a request under sections 13 to 20 to the Data Subject without undue delay and in any event within two months of receipt of the request. Where the Data Subject makes the request by means of an electronic form, the information may be provided by electronic means where possible, unless otherwise requested by the Data Subject.  
(4) The period referred to in section 10(3) may be extended by one month, where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests including any related requests received by the Controller whether or not from the same Data Subject. The Controller must inform the Data Subject of any such extension within two months of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay.  
(5) If the Controller does not take action on the request of the Data Subject, the Controller must inform the Data Subject without delay and at the latest within two months of receipt of the request of:

(a) the reasons for not taking action; and  
(b) their right to lodge a complaint with the Commissioner of Data Protection and the possibility of seeking a judicial remedy.

(6) Information provided under sections 11 and 12 and any communication and any actions taken under sections 13 to 20 and section 33 must be provided free of charge. Where requests from a Data Subject are unreasonable or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, the Controller may either:

(a) charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested; or  
(b) refuse to act on the request.

The Controller bears the burden of demonstrating the unreasonable or excessive character of the request.

(7) Without limiting section 8, where the Controller has reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the natural person making the request referred to in sections 13 to 19, the Controller may request the provision of additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the Data Subject. In such cases, the time period for complying with the Data Subject request does not begin until the Controller has received information or evidence sufficient to reasonably identify that the individual making the request is the Data Subject.  
(8) Public authorities to which Personal Data is disclosed for the exercise of their official mission, such as tax and customs authorities, financial investigation units, independent administrative authorities or financial market authorities responsible for the regulation and supervision of securities markets should not be regarded as Recipients (or categories of Recipients) for the purposes of sections 11, 12, 13, 17, 28 and 50 if they receive Personal Data which is necessary to carry out an inquiry in accordance with Applicable Law.

# 11. Information to be provided where Personal Data is collected from the Data Subject

(f) where applicable, the fact that the Controller intends to transfer Personal Data to a Recipient outside of ADGM or to an International Organisation and:

(i) the existence or absence of an adequacy decision by the Commissioner of Data Protection; or  
(ii) in the case of transfers referred to in sections 42, 43, or section 44(1)(b), reference to the appropriate or suitable safeguards and the means by which to obtain a copy of them or where they have been made available.

(2) In addition to the information referred to in section 11(1), the Controller must, at the time when Personal Data is obtained, provide the Data Subject with the following further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent Processing:

(a) the period for which the Personal Data will be stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;  
(b) the existence of the rights set out in sections 13 to 16, 18 and 19;  
(c) where the Processing is based on either of sections 5(1)(a) or 7(2)(a):

(i) the existence of the right to withdraw Consent at any time; and  
(ii) that the lawfulness of any Processing based on Consent prior to that withdrawal will not be affected by the subsequent withdrawal of Consent;

(d) the right to lodge a complaint with the Commissioner of Data Protection;  
(e) whether the provision of Personal Data is a requirement under Applicable Law, a contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract;  
(f) whether the Data Subject is obliged to provide the Personal Data and the possible consequences of failure to provide such data;  
(g) the existence of automated decision-making, including Profiling, referred to in sections 20(1) and 20(4) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such Processing for the Data Subject; and  
(h) if the Controller intends to Process Personal Data in a manner that will restrict or prevent the Data Subject from exercising their rights to request rectification or erasure of Personal Data in accordance with sections 14(1) or 15(1), or to object to the Processing of the Personal Data in accordance with section 19. In such cases, the Controller must:

(i) include a clear and explicit explanation of the expected impact on such rights; and  
(ii) satisfy itself that the Data Subject understands and acknowledges the extent of any such restrictions.

(3) Where the Controller intends to further Process the Personal Data for a purpose other than that for which the Personal Data was collected, the Controller must provide the Data Subject prior to that further Processing with information on that other purpose and with any relevant further information as referred to in section 11(2).  
(4) Sections 11(1), 11(2) and 11(3) do not apply to the extent that the Data Subject already has the information.

# 12. Information to be provided where Personal Data has not been obtained from the Data Subject

(1) Where Personal Data has not been obtained from the Data Subject, the Controller must provide the Data Subject with the following information:

(a) the identity and the contact details of the Controller;

(2) In addition to the information referred to in section 12(1), the Controller must provide the Data Subject with the following information necessary to ensure fair and transparent Processing in respect of the Data Subject:

(a) the period for which the Personal Data will be stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;  
(b) where the Processing is based on section 5(1)(f), the legitimate interests pursued by the Controller or by a Third Party;  
(c) the existence of the rights set out in sections 13 to 16, 18 and 19;  
(d) where Processing is based on either section 5(1)(a) or 7(2)(a),

(i) the existence of the right to withdraw Consent at any time; and  
(ii) that the lawfulness of any Processing based on Consent prior to that withdrawal will not be affected by the subsequent withdrawal of Consent;

(e) the right to lodge a complaint with the Commissioner of Data Protection;  
(f) from which source the Personal Data originates, and if applicable, whether it came from publicly accessible sources; and  
(g) the existence of automated decision-making, including Profiling, referred to in sections 20(1) and 20(4) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such Processing for the Data Subject.

(3) The Controller must provide the information referred to in sections 12(1) and 12(2):

(a) within a reasonable period after obtaining the Personal Data, but at the latest within two months, having regard to the specific circumstances in which the Personal Data is Processed;

(c) if a disclosure to another Recipient is envisaged, at the latest when the Personal Data is first disclosed.

(4) Where the Controller intends to further Process the Personal Data for a purpose other than that for which the Personal Data was obtained, the Controller must provide the Data Subject prior to that further Processing with information on that other purpose and with any relevant further information as referred to in section 12(2).  
(5) Sections 12(1) to 12(4) do not apply to the extent that:

(a) the Data Subject already has the information;  
(b) the provision of such information proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort (having regard to the number of Data Subjects, the age of the data and any appropriate safeguards adopted), in particular for processing for Archiving and Research Purposes or in so far as the obligation referred to in section 12(1) is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that Processing, provided that the Controller takes appropriate measures to protect the Data Subject's rights and legitimate interests, including making the information publicly available;  
(c) obtaining or disclosure is expressly required by Applicable Law which provides appropriate measures to protect the Data Subject's legitimate interests; or  
(d) where the Personal Data must remain confidential subject to an obligation of professional secrecy, or duty of confidentiality, regulated by Applicable Law.

# 13. Right of access by the Data Subject

(2) Where rectification of Personal Data is not feasible for technical reasons, then the Controller is not in violation of these Regulations for failing to comply with a request for rectification of the Personal Data under section 14(1), if:

(a) the Controller collected the Personal Data from the Data Subject; and  
(b) the information provided to the Data Subject under section 11(2)(h) was explicit, clear and prominent with respect to the manner of Processing the Personal Data and expressly stated that rectification of the Personal Data at the request of the Data Subject would not be feasible.

# 15. Right to erasure

(1) The Data Subject has the right to obtain from the Controller the erasure of Personal Data concerning him or her without undue delay and the Controller has the obligation to erase Personal Data without undue delay where one of the following applies:

(a) the Personal Data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise Processed;

(b) the Data Subject withdraws Consent on which the Processing is based according to section 5(1)(a) or 7(2)(a), and where there is no other legal ground for the Processing;  
(c) the Data Subject objects to the Processing pursuant to section 19(1) and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the Processing, or the Data Subject objects to the Processing pursuant to section 19(3);  
(d) the Personal Data has been unlawfully Processed; or  
(e) the Personal Data has to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Applicable Law to which the Controller is subject.

(2) Where the Controller has made the Personal Data public and is obliged pursuant to section 15(1) to erase the Personal Data, the Controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, must take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform Controllers which are Processing the Personal Data that the Data Subject has requested the erasure by such Controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, that Personal Data.  
(3) Sections 15(1) and 15(2) will not apply to the extent that Processing is necessary:

(a) for compliance with a legal obligation which requires Processing under Applicable Law to which the Controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out by a public authority in the interests of ADGM, or in the exercise of (i) ADGM's; (ii) the Financial Services Regulatory Authority's; (iii) the ADGM Court's; and (iv) the Registration Authority's functions or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Controller;  
(b) for reasons of public interest in the area of public health in accordance with sections 7(2)(d) and 7(2)(e);  
(c) for Archiving and Research Purposes to the extent that the right referred to in section 15(1) is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that Processing, or  
(d) for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

(4) Where erasure of Personal Data is not feasible for technical reasons, then the Controller is not in violation of these Regulations for failing to comply with a request for erasure of the Personal Data under section 15(1), if:

(a) the Controller collected the Personal Data from the Data Subject; and  
(b) the information provided to the Data Subject under section 11(2)(h) was explicit, clear and prominent with respect to the manner of Processing the Personal Data and expressly stated that erasure of the Personal Data at the request of the Data Subject would not be feasible.

(d) would be likely to affect the price of a financial instrument or have a prejudicial effect on the orderly functioning of financial markets (or the efficient allocation of capital within the economy), provided that it is reasonable for the professional

taking the decision to believe that complying with the provisions above could affect someone's decision whether to:

(i) deal in, subscribe for or issue a financial instrument; or  
(ii) act in a way likely to have an effect on a business activity (such as an effect on an undertaking's capital structure, the legal or beneficial ownership of a business or asset or a person's industrial strategy);

# PART IV Controller and Processor

# 22. Responsibility of the Controller

(1) Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of Processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights of natural persons, the Controller must:

(a) implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that Processing is performed in accordance with these Regulations; and  
(b) review and update those measures where necessary.

(2) Where proportionate in relation to Processing activities, the measures referred to in section 22(1) must include the implementation of appropriate data protection policies by the Controller.

# 23. Data protection by design and by default

(1) The Controller must take appropriate steps to ensure that:

(a) its systems, business processes and practices in respect of which Personal Data is Processed are designed taking into account compliance with the principles, rights and obligations in these Regulations ('data protection by design'); and  
(b) only the Processing of Personal Data that is necessary for each specific purpose of the Processing is Processed ('data protection by default').

# 24. Data Protection Fee

(1) A Controller must, before, or as soon as reasonably practicable after, it starts Processing Personal Data under these Regulations:

(a) pay a Data Protection Fee to the Commissioner of Data Protection in respect of the twelve months from the date it commenced Processing Personal Data under these Regulations; and  
(b) notify the Commissioner of Data Protection of:

(i) its name and address (which, in the case of a registered company, will be its registered office); and  
(ii) the date it commenced Processing Personal Data under these Regulations.

(2) Each year, within one month of the expiry of the anniversary on which it commenced Processing Personal Data under these Regulations, the Controller must pay a Renewal Fee in the amount specified by rules made by the Board to the Commissioner of Data Protection.

(3) The obligations referred to in sections 24(1) and 24(2) do not apply to an Establishment employing fewer than five employees, unless it carries out High Risk Processing Activities.

# 25. Joint Controllers

(1) Where two or more Controllers jointly determine the purposes and means of Processing, they are joint Controllers. They must determine their respective responsibilities for compliance with the obligations under these Regulations in a transparent manner, in particular as regards the exercising of the rights of the Data Subject and their respective duties to provide the information referred to in sections 11 and 12, by means of an arrangement between them unless the respective responsibilities of the Controllers are determined by Applicable Law. The arrangement may designate a contact point for Data Subjects.  
(2) The arrangement referred to in section 25(1) must set out the respective roles and relationships of the joint Controllers with respect to the Data Subjects. The essence of the arrangement must be made available to the Data Subject.  
(3) Irrespective of the terms of the arrangement referred to in section 25(1), the Data Subject may exercise his or her rights under these Regulations in respect of and against each of the Controllers.

# 26. Processor

(1) Where Processing is to be carried out on behalf of a Controller, the Controller must use only Processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that Processing will meet the requirements of these Regulations and ensure the protection of the rights of the Data Subject.  
(2) The Processor must not engage another Processor without prior specific or general written authorisation of the Controller. In the case of general written authorisation, the Processor must inform the Controller of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of other Processors, thereby giving the Controller the opportunity to object to such changes.  
(3) Processing by a Processor must be governed by a contract or other legal act under Applicable Law, that is binding on the Processor with regard to the Controller and that sets out the subject-matter and duration of the Processing, the nature and purpose of the Processing, the type of Personal Data and categories of Data Subjects and the obligations and rights of the Controller. That contract or other legal act must stipulate, in particular, that the Processor:

(a) Processes the Personal Data only on documented instructions from the Controller, including with regard to transfers of Personal Data outside of ADGM or to an International Organisation, unless required to do so by Applicable Law to which the Processor is subject; in such a case, the Processor must inform the Controller of that legal requirement before Processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest;

(b) ensures that persons authorised to Process the Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate obligation of confidentiality under Applicable Law;  
(c) takes all measures required pursuant to section 30;  
(d) respects the conditions referred to in sections 26(2) and 26(5) for engaging another Processor;  
(e) taking into account the nature of the Processing, assists the Controller by appropriate technical and organisational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment of the Controller's obligation to respond to requests for exercising the Data Subject's rights in Part III;  
(f) assists the Controller in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to sections 30 to 34 taking into account the nature of Processing and the information available to the Processor;  
(g) at the choice of the Controller, deletes or returns all the Personal Data to the Controller after the end of the provision of services relating to Processing, and deletes existing copies unless Applicable Law requires storage of the Personal Data; and  
(h) makes available to the Controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations in this section and allows for and contributes to audits, including inspections, conducted by the Controller or another auditor mandated by the Controller.

(4) With regard to section 26(3)(a), the Processor must immediately inform the Controller if, in its opinion, an instruction contravenes these Regulations or other data protection provisions contained in Applicable Law.  
(5) Where a Processor engages another Processor for carrying out specific Processing activities on behalf of the Controller, the same data protection obligations as set out in the contract or other legal act between the Controller and the Processor as referred to in section 26(3) must also be imposed on that other Processor by way of a contract or other legal act under Applicable Law, in particular, providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that the Processing will meet the requirements of these Regulations. The initial Processor remains fully liable to the Controller for the performance of that other Processor's obligations.  
(6) The Commissioner of Data Protection may adopt standard contractual clauses for the matters referred to in sections 26(3) and 26(5), including by approving the then current standard contractual clauses issued by the European Commission or adopted by a Supervisory Authority for the same purpose, upon which approval of such standard contractual clauses will be incorporated into these Regulations by reference.  
(7) The contract or the other legal act referred to in sections 26(3) and 26(5) may be based, in whole or in part, on standard contractual clauses referred to in section 26(6), including

when they are part of a certification granted to the Controller or Processor pursuant to section 38.

(8) The contract or the other legal act referred to in sections 26(3) and 26(5) must be in writing.  
(9) Without limiting the effect of sections 55, 56 and 60, if a Processor contravenes these Regulations by determining the purposes and means of Processing, the Processor will be a Controller in respect of that Processing.

# 27. Processing under the authority of the Controller or Processor

The Processor and any person acting under the authority of the Controller or of the Processor, who has access to Personal Data, must not Process that data except on instructions from the Controller, unless required to do so by Applicable Law.

# 28. Records of Processing activities

(1) Each Controller must maintain a record of Processing activities under its responsibility. That record must contain all of the following information:

(a) the name and contact details of the Controller and, where applicable, the joint Controller and the Data Protection Officer;  
(b) the purposes of the Processing;  
(c) a description of the categories of Data Subjects and of the categories of Personal Data;  
(d) the categories of Recipients to whom the Personal Data has been or will be disclosed including Recipients outside of ADGM or in International Organisations;  
(e) where applicable, transfers of Personal Data outside of ADGM or to an International Organisation, including the identification of that location outside of ADGM or the International Organisation and, in the case of transfers referred to section 44(1)(b), the documentation of suitable safeguards;  
(f) where possible, the envisaged time limits for erasure of the different categories of Personal Data; and  
(g) where possible, a general description of the technical and organisational security measures referred to in section 30(1).

# 29. Cooperation with the Commissioner of Data Protection

The Controller and the Processor must cooperate, on request, with the Commissioner of Data Protection in the performance of their duties and functions.

# 30. Security of Processing

(1) Taking into account the State Of The Art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of Processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights of natural persons, the Controller and the Processor must implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including as appropriate:

(a) the Pseudonymisation and encryption of Personal Data;  
(b) the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of Processing systems and services;  
(c) the ability to restore the availability and access to Personal Data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; and  
(d) a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the Processing.

(2) In assessing the appropriate level of security the Controller and Processor must take into account the risks that are presented by Processing, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to Personal Data transmitted, stored or otherwise Processed.  
(3) The Controller and Processor must take steps to ensure that any natural person acting under the authority of the Controller or the Processor who has access to Personal Data does not Process it except on instructions from the Controller, unless they are required to do so by Applicable Law.

# 31. Cessation of Processing

(1) Where the basis for Processing changes, ceases to exist or a Controller is required to cease Processing due to the exercise of a Data Subject's rights under section 15, the

Controller must ensure that all Personal Data, including Personal Data held by Processors is:

(a) securely and permanently deleted;  
(b) anonymised so that the data is no longer Personal Data and no Data Subject can be identified from the data including where the data is lost, damaged or accidentally released;  
(c) pseudonymised; or  
(d) securely encrypted.

(2) Where a Controller is unable to ensure that Personal Data is securely and permanently deleted, anonymised, pseudonymised or securely encrypted, the Personal Data must be archived in a manner that ensures the data is put beyond further use.  
(3) "Put beyond further use" in section 31(2) means that:

(a) a Controller and a relevant Processor is unable to use the Personal Data to inform any decision with respect of the Data Subject or in a manner that affects the Data Subject in any way, other than where such Personal Data needs to be cross-checked by automated means solely in order to prevent further Processing of Personal Data related to the Data Subject;  
(b) no party has access to the Personal Data other than the Controller and any relevant Processor;  
(c) Personal Data is protected by appropriate technical and organisational security measures that are equivalent to those afforded to live Personal Data; and  
(d) a Controller and any relevant Processor have in place and must comply with a strategy for the permanent deletion, anonymisation, pseudonymisation or secure encryption of the Personal Data, complies and can demonstrate compliance with such policy.

(4) Notwithstanding section 31(1), a Controller and any relevant Processor is not required to securely and permanently delete, anonymise, pseudonymise or encrypt Personal Data or put it beyond further use, where such Personal Data:

(a) is necessary for the establishment or defence of legal claims or must be retained for compliance with Applicable Law; or  
(b) is being used in scientific research activity conducted in the public interest or in the interests of the ADGM in accordance with all Applicable Laws, in a manner that does not present risks to the rights of Data Subjects; or  
(c) is part of a dataset used to lawfully train or refine an artificial intelligence system in a manner that does not present risks to a Data Subject's rights.

(5) A Controller or Processor seeking to rely on sections 31(4)(b) or 31(4)(c) must conduct a data protection impact assessment in accordance with section 34 before doing so. Any

Processing of Personal Data in accordance with section 31(4) must be limited to the extent necessary for such purposes.

(6) A Controller or Processor must have a policy and process for managing Personal Data that is subject to section 31(4) when the grounds for retention no longer apply, and must securely and permanently delete, anonymise, pseudonymise, encrypt Personal Data or to put it beyond further use when such grounds no longer apply.

# 32. Notification of a Personal Data Breach to the Commissioner of Data Protection

(1) In the case of a Personal Data Breach, the Controller must without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the Personal Data Breach to the Commissioner of Data Protection, unless the Personal Data Breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights of natural persons. Where the notification to the Commissioner of Data Protection is not made within 72 hours, it must be accompanied by reasons for the delay.  
(2) The Processor must notify the Controller without undue delay after becoming aware of a Personal Data Breach.  
(3) The notification referred to in sections 32(1) and 32(2) must:

(a) describe the nature of the Personal Data Breach, including where possible, the categories and approximate number of Data Subjects concerned, and the categories and approximate number of Personal Data records concerned;  
(b) communicate the name and contact details of the Data Protection Officer or other contact point where more information can be obtained;  
(c) describe the likely consequences of the Personal Data Breach; and  
(d) describe the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the Controller to address the Personal Data Breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.

(4) Where it is not possible to provide the information referred to in section 32(3) at the same time, the information may be provided in phases without undue further delay.  
(5) The Controller must document any Personal Data Breaches, comprising the facts relating to the Personal Data Breach, its effects and the remedial action taken. The documentation must enable the Commissioner of Data Protection to verify compliance with this section.

# 33. Communication of a Personal Data Breach to the Data Subject

(1) When the Personal Data Breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights of natural persons, the Controller must communicate the Personal Data Breach to the Data Subject without undue delay.  
(2) The communication to the Data Subject referred to in section 33(1) must describe in clear and plain language the nature of the Personal Data Breach and contain at least the information and measures referred to in sections 32(3)(b), 32(3)(c) and 32(3)(d). The communication must where practical make recommendations for the natural person

concerned to mitigate potential adverse effects and contain sufficient detail to allow him or her to take the necessary precautions.

(3) The communication to the Data Subject referred to in section 33(1) is not required if any of the following conditions are met:

(a) the Controller has implemented appropriate technical and organisational protection measures, and those measures were applied to the Personal Data affected by the Personal Data Breach, in particular those that render the Personal Data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it, such as encryption;  
(b) the Controller has taken subsequent measures which ensure that the high risk to the rights of Data Subjects referred to in section 33(1) is no longer likely to materialise; or  
(c) it would involve disproportionate effort (having regard to the number of Data Subjects, the age of the data and any appropriate safeguards adopted). In such a case, there must instead be a public communication or similar measure whereby the Data Subjects are informed in an equally effective manner.  
(4) If the Controller has not already communicated the Personal Data Breach to the Data Subject, the Commissioner of Data Protection, having considered the likelihood of the Personal Data Breach resulting in a high risk, may require it to do so or may decide that any of the conditions referred to in section 33(3) are met.

# 34. Data Protection Impact Assessment

(1) The Controller must, prior to Processing that is likely to result in a high risk to the rights of natural persons, carry out an assessment of the impact of the envisaged Processing operations on the protection of Personal Data (a 'Data Protection Impact Assessment').  
(2) A single Data Protection Impact Assessment may address a set of similar Processing operations that present similar high risks. The outcome of the Data Protection Impact Assessment should be taken into account when determining the appropriate measures to be taken in order to demonstrate that the Processing of Personal Data complies with these Regulations.  
(3) The Controller must seek the advice of the Data Protection Officer, where designated, when carrying out a Data Protection Impact Assessment.  
(4) The Commissioner of Data Protection must publish a list of the kind of Processing operations which are subject to the requirement for a Data Protection Impact Assessment pursuant to section 34(1) and may review this list from time to time.

(5) The Data Protection Impact Assessment must:

(a) describe the nature, scope, context and purpose of the Processing;  
(b) assess necessity, proportionality and compliance measures;  
(c) identify and assess risks to individuals; and

(d) identify any additional measures to mitigate the risks identified.

(6) Where necessary, the Controller must carry out a review to assess if Processing is performed in accordance with the Data Protection Impact Assessment including when there is a change of the risk represented by Processing operations.  
(7) The Controller must notify the Commissioner of Data Protection prior to carrying out any Processing where a Data Protection Impact Assessment indicates that the Processing would be likely to result in a high risk to the rights of natural persons. The notification must contain information in section 34(5).

# 35. Designation of the Data Protection Officer

(1) Where a Controller or Processor (i) does an act or thing that it is prohibited from doing; or (ii) omits to do an act or thing that it must do by or under:

(a) any Direction issued by the Commissioner of Data Protection under section 54;  
(b) these Regulations; or  
(c) any rules made pursuant to these Regulations,

the Commissioner of Data Protection, by written notice (a ‘Penalty Notice’) to the Controller or Processor, may impose a fine in respect of the contravention of such amount as the Commissioner of Data Protection determines to be appropriate, taking into account the factors in section 55(3). The amount determined by the Commissioner of Data Protection must not exceed USD 28 million.

(2) Any fine imposed by the Commissioner of Data Protection under section 55(1) may, depending on the circumstances of each individual case, be imposed in addition to, or instead of, measures referred to in sections 50(5)(a) to 50(5)(h) and section 50(5)(j).  
(3) When deciding whether to impose a fine and deciding on the amount of the fine in each individual case, the Commissioner of Data Protection may consider the following factors:

(a) the nature, gravity and duration of the contravention taking into account the nature scope or purpose of the Processing concerned as well as the number of Data Subjects affected, and the level of damage suffered by them;  
(b) the intentional or negligent character of the contravention;  
(c) any action taken by the Controller or Processor to mitigate the damage suffered by Data Subjects;  
(d) the degree of responsibility of the Controller or Processor taking into account technical and organisational measures implemented by them pursuant to sections 23 and 30;  
(e) any relevant previous contraventions of these Regulations or the Data Protection Regulations 2015 by the Controller or Processor;  
(f) degree of cooperation with the Commissioner of Data Protection, in order to remedy the contravention and mitigate its possible adverse effects;  
(g) the categories of Personal Data affected by the contravention;  
(h) the manner in which the contravention became known to the Commissioner of Data Protection, in particular whether, and if so to what extent, the Controller or Processor notified the Commissioner of Data Protection of the contravention;  
(i) where measures referred to in section 50(5) have previously been ordered against the Controller or Processor concerned in relation to the same subject matter, compliance with those measures;  
(j) adherence to approved codes of conduct pursuant to section 38 or approved certification mechanisms pursuant to section 39; and  
(k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as financial benefits gained, or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, from the contravention.

(4) Before giving a Controller or Processor a Penalty Notice the Commissioner of Data Protection must, by written notice (a 'Notice of Intent') inform the Controller or Processor that the Commissioner of Data Protection intends to give a Penalty Notice.  
(5) The Notice of Intent must set out:

(a) the reasons why the Commissioner of Data Protection considers it appropriate to issue a Penalty Notice;  
(b) an indication of the amount of the penalty;

(c) the period in which a Controller or Processor may make written representations about the Commissioner of Data Protection's intention to issue a Penalty Notice (which must be at least 21 days from the date of the Notice of Intent); and  
(d) whether the Commissioner of Data Protection considers it appropriate for the person to have an opportunity to make oral representations about the Commissioner of Data Protection's intention to issue a Penalty Notice.

(6) If a Controller or Processor intentionally or negligently, for the same or linked Processing operations, contravenes several provisions of these Regulations, the total amount of the administrative fine must not exceed USD 28 million.  
(7) If, within the period specified in the Penalty Notice, the Controller or Processor (as applicable):

(a) pays the fine specified in the Penalty Notice to the Commissioner of Data Protection, then no proceedings or action may be commenced, whether in the Court or otherwise, by the Commissioner of Data Protection against the Controller or Processor in respect of the relevant contravention, provided that neither the imposition nor payment of a fine restricts the Commissioner of Data Protection from taking any action against a Controller or Processor, or refrain from doing any act or thing, in respect of any continuing contravention;  
(b) has not paid the prescribed fine to the Commissioner of Data Protection, then the obligation of the Controller or Processor to pay the fine is enforceable as a debt payable to the Commissioner of Data Protection and the Commissioner of Data Protection may apply to the Court for the recovery of the debt, plus such interest, costs of enforcement (including legal costs) and other expenses directly arising from the failure to pay as the Court sees fit to order; or  
(c) has appealed to the Court in accordance with section 57, then the provisions of section 57 apply.

# 56. Fixed penalty for non-payment of the Data Protection Fee or Renewal Fee

(1) If a Controller fails to pay the Data Protection Fee or the Renewal Fee in accordance with section 24, the Commissioner of Data Protection may issue a monetary penalty, imposing a fine on the Controller of up to 150 per cent of the Data Protection Fee, or Renewal Fee, in addition to the Data Protection Fee, or Renewal Fee, as the case may be.

# 57. Right to lodge a complaint with the Commissioner of Data Protection

(2) Where multiple Data Subjects are affected by the same alleged contravention, they may raise such complaint collectively, including via a representative body. The Commissioner of Data Protection may choose to deal collectively with multiple allegations which relate to the same contravention, whether or not such allegations are brought collectively.  
(3) The Commissioner of Data Protection must assess the complaint and inform the complainant on the progress and the outcome of the complaint.  
(4) Upon completion of the assessment, the Commissioner of Data Protection may, as appropriate:

(a) dismiss the complaint;  
(b) uphold the complaint and take further action including under sections 54 or 55; or  
(c) uphold the complaint and take no further action.

# 59. Rights against a Controller and/or Processor

(1) Any person who has suffered material or non-material damage as a result of a contravention of these Regulations is entitled to compensation from the Controller or Processor for the damage suffered. Any compensation is in addition to, and will not limit, any fine imposed on the same Controller or Processor under section 55.

(2) Any Controller involved in Processing is liable for the damage caused by Processing which contravenes these Regulations.  
(3) A Processor is liable for the damage caused by Processing only where it has not complied with obligations of these Regulations specifically directed to Processors or where it has acted outside or contrary to lawful instructions of the Controller.  
(4) A Controller or Processor is exempt from liability under section 59(2) and 59(3) if it proves that it is not in any way responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.  
(5) It is a defence to a claim brought under section 59(2) for the Controller or Processor to prove that it had taken such care as in all the circumstances was reasonably required to comply with the requirement concerned.  
(6) Where more than one Controller or Processor, or both a Controller and a Processor, are involved in the same Processing and where they are responsible for any damage caused by Processing, each Controller or Processor will be held jointly and severally liable for the entire damage in order to ensure effective compensation of the Data Subject.  
(7) Where a Controller or Processor has, in accordance with section 59(6), paid full compensation for the damage suffered, that Controller or Processor is entitled to claim back from the other Controllers or Processors involved in the same Processing that part of the compensation corresponding to their part of responsibility for the damage, in accordance with the conditions set out in section 59(2) and 59(3).  
(8) Proceedings for exercising the right to receive compensation must be brought before the Court.
