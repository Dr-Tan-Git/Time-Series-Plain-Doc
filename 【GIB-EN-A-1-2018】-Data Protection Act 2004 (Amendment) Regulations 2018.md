# CHAPTER 2

# PRINCIPLES

# Overview and general duty of controller.

43.(1) This Chapter sets out the six data protection principles as follows-

(a) section 44(1) sets out the first data protection principle (requirement that processing be lawful and fair);  
(b) section 45(1) sets out the second data protection principle (requirement that purposes of processing be specified, explicit and legitimate);  
(c) section 46 sets out the third data protection principle (requirement that personal data be adequate, relevant and not excessive);  
(d) section 47(1) sets out the fourth data protection principle (requirement that personal data be accurate and kept up to date);  
(e) section 48(1) sets out the fifth data protection principle (requirement that personal data be kept for no longer than is necessary);

(f) section 49 sets out the sixth data protection principle (requirement that personal data be processed in a secure manner).

(2) In addition-

(a) each of sections 44, 45, 47 and 48 makes provision to supplement the principle to which it relates; and  
(b) sections 50 and 51 make provision about the safeguards that apply in relation to certain types of processing.

(3) The controller in relation to personal data is responsible for, and must be able to demonstrate, compliance with this Chapter.

# The first data protection principle.

44.(1) The first data protection principle is that processing of personal data for any of the law enforcement purposes must be lawful and fair.

(2) The processing of personal data for any of the law enforcement purposes is lawful only if and to the extent that it is based on law and either-

(a) the data subject has given consent to the processing for that purpose; or  
(b) the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for that purpose by a competent authority.

(3) In addition, where the processing for any of the law enforcement purposes is sensitive processing, the processing is permitted only in the following two cases-

(a) The first case is where-

(i) the data subject has given consent to the processing for the law enforcement purpose as mentioned in subsection (2)(a), and  
(ii) at the time when the processing is carried out, the controller has an appropriate policy document in place as per section 51.

(b) the second case is where-

(i) the processing is strictly necessary for the law enforcement purpose,  
(ii) the processing meets at least one of the conditions in Schedule 8, and  
(iii) at the time when the processing is carried out, the controller has an appropriate policy document in place as per section 51.

(4) The Minister may by regulations amend Schedule 8 by-

(a) adding conditions;  
(b) omitting conditions added by regulations under paragraph (a).

(5) In this section, "sensitive processing" means-

(a) the processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or trade union membership;  
(b) the processing of genetic data, or of biometric data, for the purpose of uniquely identifying an individual;  
(c) the processing of data concerning health;  
(d) the processing of data concerning an individual's sex life or sexual orientation.

# The second data protection principle.

45.(1) The second data protection principle is that-

(a) the law enforcement purpose for which personal data is collected on any occasion must be specified, explicit and legitimate; and  
(b) subject to subsections (2) and (3), personal data so collected must not be processed in a manner that is incompatible with the purpose for which it was collected.

(2) Personal data collected for a law enforcement purpose may be processed for any other law enforcement purpose, whether by the controller that collected the data or by another controller, provided that-

(a) the controller is authorised by law to process the data for the other purpose; and  
(b) the processing is necessary and proportionate to that other purpose.

(3) Personal data collected for any of the law enforcement purposes may not be processed for a purpose that is not a law enforcement purpose unless the processing is authorised by law.

# The third data protection principle.

46. The third data protection principle is that personal data processed for any of the law enforcement purposes must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose for which it is processed.

# The fourth data protection principle.

47.(1) The fourth data protection principle is that-

(a) personal data processed for any of the law enforcement purposes must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; and

(b) every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate, having regard to the law enforcement purpose for which it is processed, is erased or rectified without delay.

(2) In processing personal data for any of the law enforcement purposes, personal data based on facts must, so far as possible, be distinguished from personal data based on personal assessments.

(3) In processing personal data for any of the law enforcement purposes, a clear distinction must, where relevant and as far as possible, be made between personal data relating to different categories of data subject, such as-

(a) persons suspected of having committed or being about to commit a criminal offence;

(b) persons convicted of a criminal offence;

(c) persons who are or may be victims of a criminal offence;

(d) witnesses or other persons with information about offences.

(4) All reasonable steps must be taken to ensure that personal data which is inaccurate, incomplete or no longer up to date is not transmitted or made available for any of the law enforcement purposes.

(5) For that purpose-

(a) the quality of personal data must be verified before it is transmitted or made available;

(b) in all transmissions of personal data, the necessary information enabling the recipient to assess the degree of accuracy, completeness and reliability of the data and the extent to which it is up to date must be included; and

(c) if, after personal data has been transmitted, it emerges that the data was incorrect or that the transmission was unlawful, the recipient must be notified without delay.

# The fifth data protection principle.

48.(1) The fifth data protection principle is that personal data processed for any of the law enforcement purposes must be kept for no longer than is necessary for the purpose for which it is processed.

(2) Appropriate time limits must be established for the periodic review of the need for the continued storage of personal data for any of the law enforcement purposes.

# The sixth data protection principle.

49. The sixth data protection principle is that personal data processed for any of the law enforcement purposes must be so processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, using appropriate technical or organisational measures (and, in this principle, "appropriate security" includes protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage).

# Safeguards: archiving.

50.(1) This section applies in relation to the processing of personal data for a law enforcement purpose where the processing is necessary-

(a) for archiving purposes in the public interest;  
(b) for scientific or historical research purposes; or  
(c) for statistical purposes.

(2) The processing is not permitted if

(a) it is carried out for the purposes of, or in connection with, measures or decisions with respect to a particular data subject; or

(b) it is likely to cause substantial damage or substantial distress to a data subject.

# Safeguards: sensitive processing.

51.(1) This section applies for the purposes of section 44(4) and (5), which require a controller to have an appropriate policy document in place when carrying out sensitive processing in reliance on the consent of the data subject or, as the case may be, in reliance on a condition specified in Schedule 8.

(2) The controller has an appropriate policy document in place in relation to the sensitive processing if the controller has produced a document which-

(a) explains the controller's procedures for securing compliance with the data protection principles (see section 43(1)) in connection with sensitive processing in reliance on the consent of the data subject or, as the case may be, in reliance on the condition in question; and  
(b) explains the controller's policies as regards the retention and erasure of personal data processed in reliance on the consent of the data subject or, as the case may be, in reliance on the condition in question, giving an indication of how long such personal data is likely to be retained.

(3) Where personal data is processed on the basis that an appropriate policy document is in place, the controller must during the relevant period-

(a) retain the appropriate policy document;  
(b) review and, if appropriate, update it from time to time; and  
(c) make it available to the Commissioner, on request, without charge.

(4) The record maintained by the controller under section 70(1) and, where the sensitive processing is carried out by a processor on behalf of the controller, the record maintained by the processor under section 70(3) must include the following information-

(a) whether the sensitive processing is carried out in reliance on the consent of the data subject or, if not, which condition in Schedule 8 is relied on;  
(b) how the processing satisfies section 44 (lawfulness of processing); and  
(c) whether the personal data is retained and erased in accordance with the policies described in subsection (2)(b) and, if it is not, the reasons for not following those policies.

(5) In this section, "relevant period", in relation to sensitive processing in reliance on the consent of the data subject or in reliance on a condition specified in Schedule 8, means a period which-

(a) begins when the controller starts to carry out the sensitive processing in reliance on the data subject's consent or, as the case may be, in reliance on that condition; and  
(b) ends at the end of the period of 6 months beginning when the controller ceases to carry out the processing.

# CHAPTER 5

# TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA TO THIRD COUNTRIES ETC

Overview and interpretation

# Overview and interpretation.

81.(1) This Chapter deals with the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations, as follows-

(a) sections 82 to 85 set out the general conditions that apply;  
(b) section 86 sets out the special conditions that apply where the intended recipient of personal data is not a relevant authority in a third country or an international organisation;  
(c) section 87 makes special provision about subsequent transfers of personal data.

(2) In this Chapter

"relevant authority", in relation to a third country, means any person based in a third country that has, in that country, functions comparable to those of a competent authority;

"Member State" shall, unless otherwise stated, include the United Kingdom.

General principles for transfers

# General principles for transfers of personal data.

82.(1) A controller may not transfer personal data to a third country or to an international organisation unless-

(a) the three conditions set out in subsections (2) to (4) are met; and

(b) in a case where the personal data was originally transmitted or otherwise made available to the controller or another competent authority by a Member State, that Member State, or any person based in that Member State which is a competent authority for the purposes of the Law Enforcement Directive, has authorised the transfer in accordance with the law of the Member State.

(2) Condition 1 is that the transfer is necessary for any of the law enforcement purposes.

(3) Condition 2 is that the transfer

(a) is based on an adequacy decision as per section 83;  
(b) if not based on an adequacy decision, is based on there being appropriate safeguards as per section 84; or  
(c) if not based on an adequacy decision or on there being appropriate safeguards, is based on special circumstances as per section 85.

(4) Condition 3 is that-

(a) the intended recipient is a relevant authority in a third country or an international organisation that is a relevant international organisation; or  
(b) in a case where the controller is a competent authority specified in Schedule 7-

(i) the intended recipient is a person in a third country other than a relevant authority, and  
(ii) the additional conditions in section 86 are met.

(5) Authorisation is not required as mentioned in subsection (1)(b) if-

(a) the transfer is necessary for the prevention of an immediate and serious threat either to the public security of a Member State or a third country or to the essential interests of a Member State; and  
(b) the authorisation cannot be obtained in good time.

(6) Where a transfer is made without the authorisation mentioned in subsection (1)(b), the authority in the Member State which would have been responsible for deciding whether to authorise the transfer must be informed without delay.  
(7) In this section, "relevant international organisation" means an international organisation that carries out functions for any of the law enforcement purposes.

# Transfers on the basis of an adequacy decision.

83. A transfer of personal data to a third country or an international organisation is based on an adequacy decision where-

(a) the European Commission has decided, in accordance with Article 36 of the Law Enforcement Directive, that-  
(i) the third country or a territory or one or more specified sectors within that third country, or  
(ii) as the case may be, the international organisation, ensures an adequate level of protection of personal data; and  
(b) that decision has not been repealed or suspended, or amended in a way that demonstrates that the European Commission no longer considers there to be an adequate level of protection of personal data.

# Transfers on the basis of appropriate safeguards.

84.(1) A transfer of personal data to a third country or an international organisation is based on there being appropriate safeguards where-

(a) a legal instrument containing appropriate safeguards for the protection of personal data binds the intended recipient of the data; or  
(b) the controller, having assessed all the circumstances surrounding transfers of that type of personal data to the third country or international organisation, concludes that appropriate safeguards exist to protect the data.

(2) The controller must inform the Commissioner about the categories of data transfers that take place in reliance on subsection (1)(b).

(3) Where a transfer of data takes place in reliance on subsection (1)-

(a) the transfer must be documented;  
(b) the documentation must be provided to the Commissioner on request; and  
(c) the documentation must include, in particular-

(i) the date and time of the transfer,  
(ii) the name of and any other pertinent information about the recipient,  
(iii) the justification for the transfer, and  
(iv) a description of the personal data transferred.

# Transfers on the basis of special circumstances.

85.(1) A transfer of personal data to a third country or international organisation is based on special circumstances where the transfer is necessary-

(a) to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another person;

(b) to safeguard the legitimate interests of the data subject;  
(c) for the prevention of an immediate and serious threat to the public security of a Member State or a third country;  
(d) in individual cases for any of the law enforcement purposes; or  
(e) in individual cases for a legal purpose.

(3) Where a transfer of data takes place in reliance on subsection (1)-

(a) the transfer must be documented;  
(b) the documentation must be provided to the Commissioner on request; and  
(c) the documentation must include, in particular

(i) the date and time of the transfer,

Transfers to particular recipients

# Transfers of personal data to persons other than relevant authorities.

86.(1) The additional conditions referred to in section 82(4)(b)(ii) are the following four conditions-

(a) condition 1 is that the transfer is strictly necessary in a specific case for the performance of a task of the transferring controller as provided by law for any of the law enforcement purposes;  
(b) condition 2 is that the transferring controller has determined that there are no fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject concerned that override the public interest necessitating the transfer;  
(c) condition 3 is that the transferring controller considers that the transfer of the personal data to a relevant authority in the third country would be ineffective or inappropriate, for example, where the transfer could not be made in sufficient time to enable its purpose to be fulfilled;  
(d) condition 4 is that the transferring controller informs the intended recipient of the specific purpose or purposes for which the personal data may, so far as necessary, be processed.

Subsequent transfers

# Subsequent transfers.

87.(1) Where personal data is transferred in accordance with section 82, the transferring controller must make it a condition of the transfer that the data is not to be further transferred to a third country or international organisation without the authorisation of the transferring controller or another competent authority.

(2) A competent authority may give an authorisation under subsection (1) only where the further transfer is necessary for a law enforcement purpose.  
(3) In deciding whether to give the authorisation, the competent authority must take into account, among any other relevant factors-

(a) the seriousness of the circumstances leading to the request for authorisation;  
(b) the purpose for which the personal data was originally transferred; and  
(c) the standards for the protection of personal data that apply in the third country or international

organisation to which the personal data would be transferred.

(4) In a case where the personal data was originally transmitted or otherwise made available to the transferring controller or another competent authority by a Member State, an authorisation may not be given under subsection (1) unless that Member State, or any person based in that Member State which is a competent authority for the purposes of the Law Enforcement Directive, has authorised the transfer in accordance with the law of the Member State.

(5) Authorisation is not required as mentioned in subsection (4) if-

(a) the transfer is necessary for the prevention of an immediate and serious threat either to the public security of a Member State or a third country or to the essential interests of a Member State; and

(b) the authorisation cannot be obtained in good time.

(6) Where a transfer is made without the authorisation mentioned in subsection (4), the authority in the Member State which would have been responsible for deciding whether to authorise the transfer must be informed without delay.

88.(1) A Minister may issue a certificate certifying, for the purposes of section 53(4), 54(4), 57(3) or 77(7), that a restriction is a necessary and proportionate measure to protect the security of Gibraltar.

(2) The certificate may

(a) relate to a specific restriction, described in the certificate, which a controller has imposed or is proposing to impose under section 53(4), 54(4), 57(3) or 77(7); or

(b) identify any restriction to which it relates by means of a general description.

(3) Subject to subsection (6), a certificate issued under subsection (1) is conclusive evidence that the specific restriction or, as the case may be, any restriction falling within the general description is, or at any time was, a necessary and proportionate measure to protect the security of Gibraltar.  
(4) A certificate issued under subsection (1) may be expressed to have prospective effect.  
(5) Any person directly affected by the issuing of a certificate under subsection (1) may appeal to the Magistrate's Court against the certificate.

(a) allow the appeal; and  
(b) quash the certificate.

(7) Where in any proceedings under or by virtue of this Act, it is claimed by a controller that a restriction falls within a general description in a certificate issued under subsection (1), any other party to the proceedings may appeal to the Magistrate's Court on the ground that the restriction does not fall within that description.  
(8) Subject to any determination under subsection (9), the restriction is to be conclusively presumed to fall within the general description.

(a) received in evidence; and  
(b) deemed to be such a certificate unless the contrary is proved.

(11) A document which purports to be certified by or on behalf of a Minister as a true copy of a certificate issued by that Minister under subsection (1) is in any legal proceedings, evidence of that certificate.  
(12) The power conferred by subsection (1) on a Minister is exercisable also by the Attorney General.  
(13) No power conferred by any provision of Part VI may be exercised in relation to the imposition of-
