# Information Privacy Act 2009

Act No. 14 of 2009

An Act to provide safeguards for the handling of personal information in the public sector environment, and to allow access to and amendment of personal information

[Assented to 12 June 2009]

# The Parliament of Queensland enacts—

# Chapter 1 Preliminary

# Part 1 Introductory

# 1 Short title

This Act may be cited as the Information Privacy Act 2009.

# 2 Commencement

This Act commences on a day to be fixed by proclamation.

# 3 Object of Act

(1) The primary object of this Act is to provide for

(a) the fair collection and handling in the public sector environment of personal information; and  
(b) a right of access to, and amendment of, personal information in the government's possession or under the government's control unless, on balance, it is contrary to the public interest to give the access or allow the information to be amended.

(2) The Act must be applied and interpreted to further the primary object.

# 4 Act not intended to prevent other accessing or amendment of personal information

(1) This Act is not intended to prevent or discourage the giving of access to, or allowing the amendment of, documents otherwise than under this Act if the giving of access or the

allowing of amendment can properly be done or is permitted or required to be done by law.

(2) To remove any doubt, it is declared that subsection (1) applies to—

(a) the giving of access to, or allowing the amendment of, documents that are not documents for chapter 3 or documents to which the privacy principles do not apply; or  
(b) the giving of access to, or allowing the amendment of, documents by—

(i) an entity that is not an entity for chapter 3; or  
(ii) an entity to which the privacy principles do not apply; or  
(iii) an entity to which the privacy principles do not apply in relation to a particular function.

# 5 Relationship with other Acts requiring access to or amendment of personal information

Without limiting section 4, this Act does not affect the operation of another Act, and chapter 3 does not affect the operation of an administrative scheme, whether or not under an Act, that—

(a) requires information about personal information in the possession, or under the control, of government to be made available to members of the community; or  
(b) enables an individual to be given access to or to amend the individual's personal information in the possession, or under the control, of government;

whether or not on payment of a charge.

# 6 Scope of personal information under this Act

This Act applies to the collection of personal information, regardless of when it came into existence, and to the storage, handling, accessing, amendment, management, transfer, use and disclosure of personal information regardless of when it was collected.

# 7 Relationship with other Acts prohibiting disclosure of information

(1) Chapter 3 overrides the provisions of other Acts prohibiting the disclosure of personal information (however described).

# Notes—

1 The Parliament considers that personal information the disclosure of which is prohibited under a provision of an Act mentioned in the Right to Information Act, schedule 3, section 12 is information the disclosure of which would, on balance, be contrary to the public interest—see the Right to Information Act, section 44(2)(a), as applied under this Act, and schedule 3, section 12 of that Act.  
2 This information is called exempt information and, under the Right to Information Act, section 47(3)(a), as applied under this Act, an agency or Minister may refuse access to a document to the extent the document comprises exempt information.  
3 However, an agency or Minister may give access to a document even if this Act provides that access to the document may be refused—see section 64(4).

(2) Other than as provided for in subsection (1), this Act is intended to operate subject to the provisions of other Acts relating to—

(a) the collection, storage, handling, accessing, amendment, management, transfer, and use of personal information; and  
(b) the disclosure, within the meaning of section 23, of personal information.

# 8 Relationship with other Acts regulating disposal of information

This Act does not affect the provisions of other Acts regulating the disposal of information (however described).

Note—

For example, the Public Records Act 2002, section 13 provides—

# 13 Disposal of public records

A person must not dispose of a public record unless the record is disposed of under—

(a) an authority given by the archivist; or  
(b) other legal authority, justification or excuse.

Maximum penalty—165 penalty units.

# 9 Relationship with Right to Information Act

(1) The Right to Information Act also provides for access to documents of an agency or Minister.  
(2) If, on its face, an access application made under the Right to Information Act could have been made under this Act, the Right to Information Act, section 34 applies.

Notes—

1 Under the Right to Information Act, section 34

(a) the applicant is given an opportunity to have the application dealt with under this Act and the application fee refunded; or  
(b) the application may be continue to be dealt with as an application under the Right to Information Act.

2 To facilitate this situation, the approved form for an access application under the Right to Information Act is the same as the approved form for an access application under this Act and agencies will make appropriate administrative arrangements.  
3 If the applicant asks for the application to be dealt with under this Act, the applicant is taken to have made the application under this Act on the date of the request—see the Right to Information Act, section 34(3)(a).

# 10 Act binds State

This Act binds the State.

# Part 5 Decision

# Division 1 Access applications

# 64 Pro-disclosure bias in deciding access to documents

(1) It is the Parliament's intention that if an access application is made to an agency or Minister for a document, the agency or Minister should decide to give access to the document unless giving access would, on balance, be contrary to the public interest.  
(2) The purpose of this part is to help the agency or Minister decide whether giving access would, on balance, be contrary to the public interest by—  
(a) setting out in the Right to Information Act, schedule 3, as applied under this Act, types of information the disclosure of which the Parliament has considered would, on balance, be contrary to the public interest; and  
(b) setting out in the Right to Information Act, section 49, as applied under this Act, the steps, and in schedule 4 of that Act, as applied under this Act, factors, for deciding, for other types of information, whether disclosure would, on balance, be contrary to the public interest.  
(3) Also, the Right to Information Act, sections 50 and 51, as applied under this Act, set out circumstances concerning information about a child and personal healthcare information about an applicant in which the Parliament has stated its intention about what is in the best interests of the child and applicant.  
(4) However, it is the Parliament's intention that this Act should be administered with a pro-disclosure bias and an agency or Minister may give access to a document in relation to an applicant's personal information even if this Act provides that access to the document may be refused.

# 65 Considered decision on access application

If a person makes an access application for a document to an agency or Minister, the agency or Minister must—

(a) after considering the application, make a decision (a considered decision)—

# 66 Deemed decision on access application

(1) If an applicant is not given written notice of the decision by the end of the processing period for an access application for a document, on the last day of the processing period, the principal officer of the agency or the Minister is taken to have made a decision (a deemed decision) refusing access to the document.  
(2) As soon as practicable after a deemed decision is taken to have been made, the principal officer or Minister must give prescribed written notice of the decision to the applicant.

# 67 Grounds on which access may be refused

(1) An agency may refuse access to a document of the agency and a Minister may refuse access to a document of the Minister in the same way and to the same extent the agency or Minister could refuse access to the document under the Right to Information Act, section 47 were the document to be the subject of an access application under that Act.

Note—

See the Right to Information Act, section 47 (Grounds on which access may be refused). Generally, the grounds for refusal relate to issues concerning exempt information, the public interest, a child or applicant's best interests, documents being nonexistent or unable to be

located and other availability of access to documents. However, see also section 4 (Act not intended to prevent other accessing or amendment of personal information) of this Act.

(2) It is the Parliament's intention that

(a) the grounds on which access may be refused under the Right to Information Act, as applied under this Act, are to be interpreted narrowly; and  
(b) an agency or Minister may give access to a document even if a ground on which access may be refused applies.

(c) if access is to be given to a copy of a document subject to the deletion under section 89 of exempt information—

(i) the fact that the document is such a copy; and  
(ii) the provision of the Right to Information Act, schedule 3 under which the information is exempt information; and  
(iii) the reasons for the decision classifying the information as exempt information;

(d) if access is to be given to a copy of a document subject to the deletion under section 90 of contrary to public interest information—

(B) the reasons for the decision that, on balance, disclosure would be contrary to the public interest; and

(iv) if access is refused under the Right to Information Act, section 47(3)(c), as applied under this Act—the reason under the Right to Information Act, section 50 the agency or Minister considers access would not be in the best interests of the child; and

(v) if access is refused under the Right to Information Act, section 47(3)(d), as applied under this Act—the reason under the Right to Information Act, section 51 the agency or Minister considers that the disclosure to the applicant might be

prejudicial to the physical or mental health or wellbeing of the applicant; and

(vi) if access is refused under the Right to Information Act, section 47(3)(e), as applied under this Act—the provision of the Right to Information Act, section 52(1) under which the document is nonexistent or unlocatable; and

(2) For an access application for a document containing prescribed information, the agency or Minister may give prescribed written notice that does not include the details mentioned in section 199(a) or (b) but, by way of a decision, states that—

(a) the agency or Minister neither confirms nor denies the existence of that type of document as a document of the agency or a document of the Minister; but  
(b) assuming the existence of the document, it would be a document to which access would be refused under

section 67 to the extent it comprised prescribed information.

# Division 2 Amendment applications

# 70 Considered decision on amendment application

If a person makes an amendment application for a document to an agency or Minister, the agency or Minister must—
