Part 2D-Enhanced security regulation for critical telecommunications assets
Division 1-Introduction
30EA  Simplified outline of this Part
The responsible entity for a critical telecommunications asset that is prescribed by the rules has an obligation to protect the asset, so far as it is reasonably practicable to do so, for the purposes of:
	(a)	security; and
	(b)	the protection of the asset from any hazard where there is a material risk that the occurrence of the hazard could have a relevant impact on the asset.
The responsible entity for a critical telecommunications asset that is prescribed by the rules must notify the Secretary of certain changes, and proposed changes, to telecommunications services or telecommunications systems if the change, or proposed change, is likely to have a material adverse effect on the entity's capacity to comply with the obligation to protect the asset for the purposes of security.
The Minister may direct the responsible entity for a critical telecommunications asset not to use or supply, or to cease using or supplying, a carriage service, if the Minister considers that the use or supply would be, or is, prejudicial to security.
Division 2-Responsible entity's obligation to protect critical telecommunications assets
30EB  Responsible entity's obligation to protect critical telecommunications assets
	(1)	This section applies to a critical telecommunications asset that is prescribed by the rules for the purposes of this subsection.
Note:	For specification by class, see subsection 13(3) of the Legislation Act 2003.
	(2)	For the purposes of security and the protection of a critical telecommunications asset from any hazard where there is a material risk that the occurrence of the hazard could have a relevant impact on the asset, the responsible entity for the asset must, so far as it is reasonably practicable to do so, protect the asset to ensure:
	(a)	the confidentiality of communications (as defined in the Telecommunications Act 1997) carried on, and of information contained on, the asset; and
	(b)	the availability and integrity of the asset.
Note:	Security has the same meaning as in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979: see the definition of security in section 5 of this Act.
Civil penalty:	1,500 penalty units.
	(3)	Without limiting subsection (2), the responsible entity's obligation under that subsection in respect of the critical telecommunications asset includes complying with the following:
	(a)	any requirements that apply to the entity and the asset under Part 2A (critical infrastructure risk management programs);
	(b)	the requirement to maintain competent supervision of, and effective control over, the asset;
	(c)	any other requirements prescribed by the rules for the purposes of this paragraph.
	(4)	An entity is not liable to an action or other proceeding for damages for or in relation to an act done or omitted in good faith in performance of the obligation imposed by subsection (2).

Endnotes
Endnote 1-About the endnotes
The endnotes provide information about this compilation and the compiled law.
The following endnotes are included in every compilation:
Endnote 1-About the endnotes
Endnote 2-Abbreviation key
Endnote 3-Legislation history
Endnote 4-Amendment history
Abbreviation key-Endnote 2
The abbreviation key sets out abbreviations that may be used in the endnotes.
Legislation history and amendment history-Endnotes 3 and 4
Amending laws are annotated in the legislation history and amendment history.
The legislation history in endnote 3 provides information about each law that has amended (or will amend) the compiled law. The information includes commencement details for amending laws and details of any application, saving or transitional provisions that are not included in this compilation.
The amendment history in endnote 4 provides information about amendments at the provision (generally section or equivalent) level. It also includes information about any provision of the compiled law that has been repealed in accordance with a provision of the law.
Editorial changes
The Legislation Act 2003 authorises First Parliamentary Counsel to make editorial and presentational changes to a compiled law in preparing a compilation of the law for registration. The changes must not change the effect of the law. Editorial changes take effect from the compilation registration date.
If the compilation includes editorial changes, the endnotes include a brief outline of the changes in general terms. Full details of any changes can be obtained from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel.
Misdescribed amendments
A misdescribed amendment is an amendment that does not accurately describe how an amendment is to be made. If, despite the misdescription, the amendment can be given effect as intended, then the misdescribed amendment can be incorporated through an editorial change made under section 15V of the Legislation Act 2003.
If a misdescribed amendment cannot be given effect as intended, the amendment is not incorporated and "(md not incorp)" is added to the amendment history.
