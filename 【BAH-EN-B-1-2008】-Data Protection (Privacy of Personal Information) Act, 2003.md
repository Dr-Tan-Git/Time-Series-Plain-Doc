Exclusions to Act.

Collection, processing, keeping, use and disclosure of personal data.

(ii) shall not be used or disclosed in any manner incompatible with that purpose or those purposes;  
(iii) shall be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to that purpose or those purposes; and  
(iv) shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes, except in the case of personal data kept for historical, statistical or research purposes; and

(d) appropriate security measures shall be taken against unauthorised access to, or alteration, disclosure or destruction of, the data and against their accidental loss or destruction.  
(2) In determining for the purposes of subsection (1)(a) of this section, whether personal data or information constituting such data are fair in the circumstances of the case, regard is to be had to the method by which they are obtained, including in particular whether any person from whom they are obtained is deceived or misled as to the purpose or purposes for which they are to be processed:

Provided however that the data or the information constituting such data shall not be regarded for the purposes of subsection (1)(a) of this section as having been obtained unfairly by reason only that its use for any such purpose was not disclosed when it was obtained, if the data are not used in such a way that damage or distress is, or is likely to be, caused to any data subject.

(3) A data processor shall, as respects personal data processed by him, comply with subsection (1)(d) of this section.  
7.

8. (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, any individual who makes a written request to a data controller has a right, within forty days after complying with the provisions of this section, to —

(3) The Minister may by regulations prescribe the fee to be charged by a data controller in respect of such a request as aforesaid, and any fee so paid shall be reimbursed where the request is not complied with or the data controller rectifies, supplements, or erases part of, the data concerned (and thereby materially modifies the data) or erases all of the data on the application of the individual or in accordance with an enforcement notice hereunder or court order.  
(4) An individual making a request under this section shall supply the data controller concerned with such information as he may reasonably require in order to satisfy himself of the identity of the individual and to locate any relevant personal data or information.  
(5) Nothing in subsection (1) obliges a data controller to disclose to a data subject personal data relating to another individual unless that other individual has consented to the disclosure:

Provided that, where the circumstances are such that it would be reasonable for the data controller to conclude that, if any particulars identifying that other individual were omitted, the data could then be disclosed as aforesaid without his being thereby identified to the data subject, the data controller shall be obliged to disclose the data to the data subject with the omission of those particulars.

(6) Information supplied pursuant to a request under subsection (1) may take account of any amendment of the personal data concerned made since the receipt of the request by the data controller (being an amendment that

would have been made irrespective of the receipt of the request) but not of any other amendment.

(7) A notification of a refusal of a request made by an individual under the preceding provisions of this section shall be in writing and shall include a statement of the reasons for the refusal and an indication that the individual may complain to the Commissioner about the refusal.  
(8) Where a data controller has previously complied with a request made under subsection (1) by an individual, the data controller is not obliged to comply with a subsequent, identical or similar request under that subsection by that individual unless a reasonable interval has elapsed between compliance with the previous request and the making of the current request.  
(9) In determining for the purposes of subsection (8) whether requests under subsection (1) are made at reasonable intervals, regard shall be had to the nature of the data, the purposes for which the data are processed and the frequency with which the data are altered.

Exceptions to right of access.

9. Section 8 shall not apply to personal data —  
(a) kept for the purpose of preventing, detecting or investigating an offence or a breach of agreement, apprehending or prosecuting offenders or assessing or collecting any tax, duty or other moneys owed or payable to the Government, a local authority, a statutory corporation, or a public body, in any case in which the application of that section to the data would be likely to prejudice any of the matters aforesaid;  
(b) to which, by virtue of paragraph (a) section 8 does not apply and which are kept for the purpose of discharging a function conferred by or under any enactment and consisting of information obtained for such a purpose from a person who had it in his possession for any of the purposes mentioned in paragraph (a);  
(c) in any case in which the application of section 8 would be likely to prejudice the security of, or the maintenance of good order and discipline in a prison, a place of detention provided under the Prisons Act, or any other enactment under the laws of The Bahamas;

Ch. 208.

(d) kept for the purpose of performing such functions conferred by or under any enactment as may be specified by regulations made by the Minister, being functions that, in the opinion of the Minister, are designed to protect members of the public against financial loss in any case in which the application of that section to the data would be likely to prejudice the proper performance of any of those functions, occasioned by —

(g) in respect of which a claim of privilege could be maintained in proceedings in a court in relation to communications between a client and his professional legal advisers or between those advisers;  
(h) kept only for the purpose of preparing statistics or carrying out research if the data are not used or disclosed (other than to a person to whom a disclosure of such data may be made in the circumstances specified in section 13) for any other purpose and the resulting statistics or the results of the research are not made available in a form that identifies any of the data subjects;  
(i) in any case in which the application of that section would reveal confidential commercial

20. (1) The Commissioner may encourage trade associations and other bodies representing categories of data controllers to prepare codes of practice to be complied with by those categories in dealing with personal data.  
(2) The Commissioner may approve of any code of practice so prepared (referred to subsequently in this section as a code) if he is of opinion that it provides for the data subjects' concerned protection with regard to personal data relating to them that conforms with that provided for by sections 6, 8 (other than subsection (9)) and 10 and shall encourage its dissemination to the data controllers concerned.
