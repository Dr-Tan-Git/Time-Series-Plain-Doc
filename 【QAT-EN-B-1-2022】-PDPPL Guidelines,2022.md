# What are the third-party processors considerations?

When engaging a third party processor, the PDPPL requires controllers to verify that such processors comply with the instructions given to them, adopt appropriate precautions and monitor their compliance on a regular basis as part of their Personal Data Management System (PDMS).

With respect to a processing activity, an organization can play one or more of the following roles:

# 1

A Controller if it is the main decision-maker exercising overall control over why and how personal data is processed.

# 2

A Processor if it is following the instructions of a Controller or is processing personal data on their behalf.

# 3

A Joint-Controller if it jointly makes decisions or exercises shared control over why and how the personal data is processed.

What does the PDPPL say in regards to third-party processors?
