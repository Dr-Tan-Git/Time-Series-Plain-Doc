A controller that intends to extend the period for responding shall notify the consumer within the initial 45-day response period and explain the reason for the extension.  
(b) Notify the consumer without undue delay and not later than 45 days after receiving the consumer's request if the controller declines to take action on the request.

If the controller denies the appeal, the notice must provide or specify information that enables the consumer to contact the Attorney General to submit a complaint.  
(7) A controller that obtains personal data about a consumer from a source other than the consumer complies with the consumer's request to delete the personal data if the controller:  
(a) deletes the data but retains a record of the deletion request and a minimal amount of data necessary to ensure that the personal data remains deleted and does not use the minimal data for any other purpose; or  
(b) Opts the consumer out of the controller's processing of the consumer's personal data for any purpose other than a purpose that is exempt under section 2 of this 2023 Act.

SECTION 5. (1) A controller shall:

(a) Specify in the privacy notice described in subsection (4) of this section the express purposes for which the controller is collecting and processing personal data;  
(b) Limit the controller's collection of personal data to only the personal data that is adequate, relevant and reasonably necessary to serve the purposes the controller specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection;  
(c) Establish, implement and maintain for personal data the same safeguards described in ORS 646A.622 that are required for protecting personal information, as defined in ORS 646A.602, such that the controller's safeguards protect the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of the personal data to the extent appropriate for the volume and nature of the personal data; and  
(d) Provide an effective means by which a consumer may revoke consent a consumer gave under sections 1 to 9 of this 2023 Act to the controller's processing of the consumer's personal data. The means must be at least as easy as the means by which the consumer provided consent. Once the consumer revokes consent, the controller shall cease processing

the personal data as soon as is practicable, but not later than 15 days after receiving the revocation.

(2) A controller may not:  
(a) Process personal data for purposes that are not reasonably necessary for and compatible with the purposes the controller specified in subsection (1)(a) of this section, unless the controller obtains the consumer's consent;  
(b) Process sensitive data about a consumer without first obtaining the consumer's consent or, if the controller knows the consumer is a child, without processing the sensitive data in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, 15 U.S.C. 6501 et seq. and the regulations, rules and guidance adopted under the Act, all as in effect on the effective date of this 2023 Act;  
(c) Process a consumer's personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, of profiling the consumer in furtherance of decisions that produce legal effects or effects of similar significance or of selling the consumer's personal data without the consumer's consent if the controller has actual knowledge that, or willfully disregards whether, the consumer is at least 13 years of age and not older than 15 years of age; or  
(d) Discriminate against a consumer that exercises a right provided to the consumer under sections 1 to 9 of this 2023 Act by means such as denying goods or services, charging different prices or rates for goods or services or providing a different level of quality or selection of goods or services to the consumer.

(6) If a consumer or authorized agent uses a method described in subsection (5) of this section to opt out of a controller's processing of the consumer's personal data under section 3 (1)(d) of this 2023 Act and the decision conflicts with a consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide reward, club card or loyalty program or a program that provides premium features or discounts in return for the consumer's consent to the controller's processing of the consumer's personal data, the controller may either comply with the request to opt out or notify the consumer of the conflict and ask the consumer to affirm that the consumer intends to withdraw from the bona fide reward, club card or loyalty program or the program that provides premium features or discounts. If the consumer affirms that the consumer intends to withdraw, the controller shall comply with the request to opt out.

(3) This section does not relieve a controller or processor from any liability that accrues under sections 1 to 9 of this 2023 Act as a result of the controller's or processor's actions in processing personal data.  
(4)(a) For purposes of determining obligations under sections 1 to 9 of this 2023 Act, a person is a controller with respect to processing a set of personal data, and is subject to an action under section 9 of this 2023 Act to punish a violation of sections 1 to 9 of this 2023 Act, if the person:  
(A) Does not need to adhere to another person's instructions to process the personal data;  
(B) Does not adhere to another person's instructions with respect to processing the personal data when the person is obligated to do so; or  
(C) Begins at any point to determine the purposes and means for processing the personal data, alone or in concert with another person.

(iv) Other substantial injury to consumers.

(c) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of processing operations that present a similar heightened risk of harm.

(2) A data protection assessment shall identify and weigh how processing personal data may directly or indirectly benefit the controller, the consumer, other stakeholders and the public against potential risks to the consumer, taking into account how safeguards the controller employs can mitigate the risks. In conducting the assessment, the controller shall consider how deidentified data might reduce risks, the reasonable expectations of consumers, the context in which the data is processed and the relationship between the controller and the consumers whose personal data the controller will process.

(3) The Attorney General may require a controller to provide to the Attorney General any data protection assessments the controller has conducted if the data protection assessment is relevant to an investigation the Attorney General conducts under section 9 of this 2023 Act. The Attorney General may evaluate a data protection assessment for the controller's compliance with the requirements of section 1 to 9 of this 2023 Act. If a data protection assessment the Attorney General obtains under this subsection includes information that is subject to attorney-client privilege or is work product that is subject to a privilege, the controller's provision of the data protection assessment does not waive the privilege.

(4) A data protection assessment that a controller conducts to comply with another applicable law or regulation satisfies the requirements of this section if the data protection assessment is reasonably similar in scope and effect to a data protection assessment conducted under this section.  
(5) Requirements that apply to a data protection assessment under this section apply only to processing activities that occur on and after July 1, 2024, and are not retroactive.  
(6) A controller shall retain for at least five years all data protection assessments the controller conducts under this section.

A claim available under another provision of law may be joined to the Attorney General's claim under subsection (4) of this section.  
(8) The Attorney General has exclusive authority to enforce the provisions of sections 1 to 9 of this 2023 Act. Sections 1 to 9 of this 2023 Act, or any other laws of this state, do not create a private right of action to enforce a violation of sections 1 to 9 of this 2023 Act.
