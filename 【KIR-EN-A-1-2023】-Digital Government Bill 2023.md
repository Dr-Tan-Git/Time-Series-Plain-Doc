# EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

# Background

In 2021, the Cabinet approved a Digital Government Plan, which aims to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the government's service delivery to the public. The plan recognizes the importance of leveraging technology to make public services more accessible, convenient, and efficient.

To achieve this goal, the Cabinet agreed on several strategies, one of which is to develop a legal framework that will provide guidelines on how the government should deliver its services. This legal framework is essential to ensure that the government's digital services are consistent, secure, and meet the needs of the public.

The development of a legal framework will involve drafting and implementing laws and regulations that govern the use of technology in public service delivery. The framework will also outline the roles and responsibilities of different government agencies and departments in providing digital services to the public.

Overall, the Digital Government Plan is an ambitious initiative that seeks to transform the way the government delivers services to the public. By developing a legal framework, the government aims to ensure that its digital services are secure, efficient, and user-friendly, ultimately improving the lives of citizens and businesses.

# Part I: Preliminary:

Part I specifies the name of this Bill "Digital Government Bill 2023" and outlines the principles that underpin the introduction of digital government. These principles serve as a guide for understanding the digital government and should be considered before implementing any digital government initiatives. All definitions of important concepts and abbreviations are listed. Furthermore, this part clearly indicates the aims to establish the Digital Transformation Office (DTO) and outline its functions, establish an ICT Advisory Board, establish the National Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), establish the ICT Audit Committee, establish a composition of ICT Practitioners, and enforce and regulate the principles and guidelines stipulated under any Government Plans relevant to digital services and ICT. Lastly, the Republic is bound by this Act and State-Owned Enterprises are not subject to the provisions of this Act.

# Part II: Administration

This part empowers Secretary to administer this Act and establishes the DTO to implement the Act. The DTO's functions include developing and updating ICT policies, coordinating digital infrastructure and services for public bodies, ensuring cyber security and safety, maintaining a register of systems and services, and enforcing compliance with the Act. The DTO has the power to delegate its functions and do what is necessary to perform its functions. If a public body does not have an ICT officer, the head of the body must nominate an officer to perform DTO functions. The DTO is responsible for developing digital skills and capacity-building programs for its officers in collaboration with other relevant agencies.

This also empowers the Director to prepare a Digital Government plan with advice from the National Digital Transformation Advisory Board and Cabinet approval. All public bodies must comply with the plan, and the Director ensures digital services are implemented accordingly. The plan is reviewed and updated every five years or as advised by the Minister. DTO Officers conduct annual self-assessments of plan implementation and submit them to the Director.

This part also describes the establishment of a group of ICT practitioners within the Ministry. The Director is responsible for determining their roles and functions and designating officers to assist other public bodies as needed. The ICT practitioners are responsible for coordinating with the DTO on ICT and Digital Transformation matters, facilitating integration and interoperability of systems, delivering digital services, managing computer data, preparing the annual ICT budget, organizing maintenance and user help desk, providing end user training, and providing reports and feedback.

Furthermore, this part establishes the Board and the Public Service ICT Audit Committee. The Board has the functions of providing advice on ICT-related issues, giving recommendations on ICT policy and legal issues, and monitoring the implementation plan. The board consists of up to 5 members appointed by the Minister, and the Public Service ICT Audit Committee is made up of representatives from various offices and organizations. The committee performs ICT audits on public bodies' systems, evaluates their compliance with regulations and standards, and reports its findings to the Director. The committee may recommend engaging an independent ICT auditor for further technical audit.

Finally, a National Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) is established within DTO to coordinate national cyber security efforts. The CERT will conduct defensive cyber security operations, promote a secured digital government environment, investigate breaches of cyber security, and provide cyber incident response services. The team will also monitor and hunt cyber threats, conduct audits on cyber security tracking and monitoring systems, establish procedures for reporting cyber incidents, and provide technical digital forensic support to the Kiribati Police Service's Cybercrime Unit. The Director may outsource any functions of the CERT.

# Part III: Digital Infrastructure

This part of the Act outlines the government's digital infrastructure, which includes critical digital infrastructure and a Government Secure Network. The DTO is responsible for coordinating the delivery of digital infrastructure, and the Minister has the authority to designate other digital infrastructure as critical digital infrastructure. The Government Leased Cloud Infrastructure and Government Private Cloud Infrastructure are established for digital services for all Ministries. The Government Computer Data Repository is established with redundant computer data repositories for backup of computer data storage and provides safety against potential unforeseen events that may cause data loss to public bodies. Access to the Government Computer Data Repository is controlled, and a person who removes destroys, alters or damages digital infrastructure or critical infrastructure commits an offence.

# Part IV: Digital Services and Related Matters

Part IV of the act deals with Digital Services and Related Matters. It outlines that public bodies may provide digital services through the internet and establish a National Digital Government Portal. The act also discusses open data and how public bodies must make it accessible. Approval for ICT project designs must be obtained from the Director, and a Certificate of Compliance is required for certain projects. Finally, the act outlines the provision and accessibility of digital services and the requirements that must be met.

The Kiribati government has outlined regulations and requirements for the use of government domain names, emails, websites, social media accounts, and digital software. The government domain .gov.ki will be managed by DTO, and all public bodies must use it for official purposes. They must also use the government domain as the email domain and website domain for all official emails and websites of the public body, respectively. The DTO will establish a register of government domain names of public bodies and social media accounts of public bodies, which must be published on the government portal. The Director or his delegate shall cause to remove digital content physically or virtually from a public body's website or social media account that does not comply with regulations. Furthermore, DTO shall regulate the social media accounts of public bodies through standards, guidelines, and specifications. Failure to comply with regulations and standards may result in fines and imprisonment. The Kiribati government will also develop standards, specifications, and guidelines on paper reduction while promoting the use of electronic identification of public officers, software-based document management systems, and electronic filing of paper-based records.

# Part V: Computer Data

This section outlines the management and protection of government computer data in a responsible and ethical manner. The DTO must build capacity, provide oversight, manage computer data architecture, and manage the data-value cycle. Computer data is classified as top-secret, confidential, or open data, and standards prescribe security controls for safeguarding each type. Unlawful use of top-secret or confidential computer data is punishable by fines and imprisonment. Public access to computer data is restricted to those who have permission from the SRO of the public body or written consent from the individual whose personal data is being stored. Public bodies must collect and store data in electronic form, and the DTO oversees computer data storage. The government computer data repository is used for computer storage, and public bodies retain ownership of their own computer data. The DTO develops prescribed standards for system integration and maintains a register of APIs and computer data. Public bodies must comply with standards for computer data sharing, and precautions must be taken to ensure secure data exchange.

# Part VI: Enforcement

This part outlines the enforcement avenues for the Act. The Secretary may issue compliance notices and directions to public bodies that fail to execute their role as per this Act. The Director is empowered to direct public bodies to provide access to their systems

and source data, investigate complaints, and stop non-compliant projects. DTO officers have powers to enter and search premises, interview people, and seize items related to a breach of the Act. An enforcement team is established to oversee implementation and report on the progress of the Act. The Secretary chairs the team and must provide a report to Cabinet twice a year, that shows the effectiveness and efficiency of the Act, issues for enforcement and implementation, and the Ministry's plan to overcome issues. Failure to provide this report on time may result in the Secretary being asked to provide an explanation to the Cabinet.

# Part VII: Offences

Part VII outlines offences related to the infringement of this Act. Any person breaching this Act shall be liable to pay up to $35,000 or up to 7 years. Obstructing the Director or any ICT practitioner in executing their duties under this Act is also an offence and can result in a maximum fine of 5,000 or imprisonment for a maximum of 1 year. Prosecution for an offence does not prevent disciplinary actions or termination of employment, and a court may order the offender to pay for repairing any damage resulting from the offence. The DTO can refer any matter of criminal nature to the Kiribati Police Services for investigation.

# Part VIII: Miscellaneous

This part covers miscellaneous elements of the Act, including immunity for those involved in enforcing the Act, absolute liability in prosecutions, the power of the Minister to make regulations, and the requirement for the DTO to develop standards and guidelines. It also includes provisions for saving and transitioning existing contracts with ICT service providers, as well as requirements for public bodies to comply with the Act within certain timeframes.
